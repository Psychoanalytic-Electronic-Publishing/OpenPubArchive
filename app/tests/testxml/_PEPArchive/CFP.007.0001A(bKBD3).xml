<p>In <impx type="UNKC">1946</impx>, Enid Eichholz (the future Enid Balint) established the very first psychotherapeutic service for the treatment of marital distress in Great Britain. Assisted by supportive colleagues from the Tavistock Clinic and the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, Mrs Eichholz's Family Discussion Bureaux soon became incorporated into the Tavistock family, and ultimately developed into the organisation now known as Tavistock Relationships, part of the Tavistock Institute of Medical Psychology. In this essay, based extensively on unpublished archival sources, the author traces the history of the couple psychoanalytic movement in Great Britain, exploring the ways in which Enid Eichholz Balint forged important collaborative partnerships, set against the backdrop of a progressive post-World War social democratic government, in order to create a new paradigm in mental health provision.</p>

        <p>In 2012, the actors Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro starred in a Hollywood film entitled
                <i>Hope Springs</i>: a touching story about a long-standing couple whose marriage
            had become somewhat anaemic, and who, after several sessions with a therapist, portrayed
            by the comedian Steve Carrell, begin to enjoy a more lively intimacy once again.
            Clearly, couple therapy has now become a fixture in popular culture; and in view of the
            increasingly frequent portrayals of this modality in such popular television
            programmes</p>
