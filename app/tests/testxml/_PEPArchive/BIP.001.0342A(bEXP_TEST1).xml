<body><p>DR. K. ABRAHAM, Berlin.  Forms of Expression of the Female Castration Complex.</p>
<p>There are various possible outcomes of the female castration complex.  The normal or cultural form, as Freud calls it, is that the woman is reconciled to her femininity; the desire to possess a male genital organ is given up and in its place appears the wish to have a child (really as a gift from her father).  This enables the woman to obtain gratification from the female sexual rôle and to develop maternal feelings.</p>
<p>The ambivalent (archaic) attitude is opposed to this outcome.  Besides the love for the man to whom she at first belonged, the woman produces feelings of hate in connection with her defloration, because the injury to her physical integrity re-awakens the castration complex.  Traces of this form of reaction can still be observed in civilised conditions.</p>
<p>A third outcome is the turning to homosexuality.  This possibility is based on the bisexual disposition of human beings.  In some of the cases the homosexuality is principally expressed in a sublimated form.</p>
<p>The neurotic outcomes, which are really the object of this paper, are extremely multiform, and many of them up to the present have hardly been noticed.</p>
<p>These neurotic symptoms partly express the wish to be male and partly are directed against the man in the sense of revenge (castration, killing).  A number of symptoms and dreams, which agree in content with the symptoms, were discussed.  In those mentioned first the patient unconsciously plays the male rôle or she expects to become male.  Certain of the neurotic symptoms</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0343" prefixused="">342</n></pb>
<p2>manifest themselves in parts of the body, which are made use of as surrogates for the male genital.  Other symptoms represent the complete refusal of the male, but at the same time they have an active castration purpose (vaginismus, etc.); or they contain a dread of such an action.  Again other symptoms serve for the disparagement or disappointment of the man.</p2><p>Certain women, who can only accustom themselves with great difficulty to the disadvantage with which they were born, under no circumstances wish to be reminded of the painful thing, they avoid with over-sensitiveness anything that could have this effect.  Horror of wounds is a particularly marked symptom of this kind (wound = female genital).</p>
<p>The tendency to compromise formation is also met with here as throughout in the psychology of the neuroses.  Many women are quite satisfied in their female rôle provided they are the most beautiful and most desired of all others, or if a man who puts all other men in the shade as regards manliness desire them.  Another expression of the female castration complex is that the man in his male (that is to say genital) function is acknowledged, only her own genital is withdrawn from use and the libido is displaced to the oral or anal zone.  Then perversions or conversion phenomena take place in connection with these erotogenic zones.</p>
<p>Women with such an attitude transplant their castration complex to their children.  They make it more difficult for girls to accept their femininity, and they permanently injure the boy's narcissistic pride in manliness.  The castration complex in the mother, in particular her anal-erotism, is an important factor aetiologically as regards the pathological expressions of the castration complex in the children.  The treatment of the woman therefore offers a possibility of guarding the descendents against the risk of a neurosis; here lies a particularly fruitful field of work for psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>DR. HELENE DEUTSCH, Vienna.  On the Psychology of Suspicion.</p>
<p>The lecturer deals with the psychic mechanisms of suspicion as a neurotic symptom, as a character trait, as a psychic phenomenon in deafness, and as a phenomenon of mass psychology.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0344" prefixused="">343</n></pb>
<p>The conduct of the suspicious person towards his environment shows that he is in constant expectancy of a hostile attack, and that he seeks to protect himself from this.  Since this danger threatening him is not real, or observed in the external world, psycho-analysis considers that it has its origin in the unconscious.  The mechanisms concerned with suspicion as a pathological symptom are discussed in four analysed cases.  In the first case the suspicion corresponded with the projection of the endopsychic perception of an impulse of danger threatening the ego from the unconscious.  Allusion was made to certain analogies between this mechanism of projection and the mechanism acting in anxiety hysteria.</p>
<p>In the second case the symptom was explained by the conflict of ambivalency, in that the suspicion represented the projection of repressed hate tendencies into the external world.  The relations existing between suspicion and doubt were discussed.</p>
<p>The suspicion in the third case had its cause in the continual oscillation of the libido between heterosexual and homosexual object choice.  This psychic formation showed that every attempt at object choice was accompanied by strong negative tendencies.  The endopsychic perception of tendencies hostile to the ego of homosexual and incestuous love was projected externally, likewise hate directed against the woman or the man succumbed to projection and was apperceived as suspicion.</p>
<p>The fourth case, a beginning paranoia, showed great suspicion before the outbreak of the psychosis, in which nevertheless hysterical mechanisms could be demonstrated.  The relations of suspicion to paranoia were discussed with especial reference to the differences and analogies.</p>
<p>Suspicion makes use of projection like the delusion of persecution, but in distinction from paranoia it does not always have homosexuality as its basis; also there is lacking the characteristic change of affect seen in paranoia.</p>
<p>In the origin of suspicion as a character trait the same mechanisms of projection hold good, the endopsychic perception of an impulse of danger, with the exception that here the individual has definitely freed himself from the danger in this manner.  The constitutional strengthening of the anal-sadistic impulses offers particularly favourable conditions for the origin of suspicion, whereby one's own hostility is projected externally and produces the feeling of the threatening danger.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0345" prefixused="">344</n></pb>
<p>In the origin of suspicion in deafness it is assumed that the strengthening of the sadism present in everybody comes about through the weakening of the ego; also human beings apparently need the control of all their senses in order to resist the feeling of uncertainty in the external world arising from their own hostility.</p>
<p>It was also noted that suspicion after the war had become a general phenomenon, and this goes back to the sadism released through the war, of which suspicion forms the last trace.</p>
<p>Another important cause of suspicion is seen in the disappointments which the child has experienced in his first love objects.  These disappointments leave behind the scar which contributes to the deformity of character in the sense of suspicion, or under suitable conditions can lead to the appearance of this symptom in the neuroses.</p>
<p>DR. A. STÄRCKE, Den Dolder, Holland.  The Castration Complex.</p>
<p>The Castration Complex is one part of a disposition towards ambivalency, the other part of which—namely, wishes and tendencies of various kinds and the infantile theory of the woman with the penis—shows the same origin.</p>
<p>The infant acquires this disposition towards ambivalency while sucking at the mother's breast or the bottle; the excremental functions are also factors concerned, as has been described by Prof. Freud, and perhaps the act of divesting the infant of other things, as for instance clothes, may play a part.</p>
<p>Attention is directed towards deviations from the normal nursing, as these must exercise an influence on the budding psyche which cannot be overrated.  It is suggested that the pains the mother suffers while nursing may be of importance for arousing or fixing sadistic tendencies, and also that the situation at the breast introduces the process of projection.  The nipple in the baby's mouth is, in accordance with his degree of development a part of his own body.  The withdrawing of the nipple and the excremental functions engender the first traces of the conception of a separate outer world.  The wish to reunite the Ego and the</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0346" prefixused="">345</n></pb>
<p2>outer world, a desire which is equated with the striving after happiness, means the wishing of the sucking situation back again.  The formation of the outer world is the original castration; the withdrawal of the nipple forms the root-conception of this.</p2><p>DR. V. HATTINGBERG, Munich.  Transference and Object Choice; their Significance as regards the Theory of Instinct.</p>
<p>The theory of transference like that of object choice is based on the idea that feeling and impulse are independent of their object.  This statement of Freud, in support of which are brought forward many examples from the instinctive life of animals, is a central point for the whole theory of instinct.  From the various possible conceptions of instinctive actions are eliminated all those that consider the object as essential for the instinct, whether as a stimulus as in the Tropism theory and the reflex theory of the instincts, or as aim or idea of purpose as in the psychology of consciousness.  There remain only two possible conceptions, one that claims a condition of the individual himself as point of relation as regards "direction", the essential thing in instinctive actions.  Instinct actions are alterations of the entire conduct which appear in typical situations.  They are connections of functions and alterations of functions which originate in a typical initial state of the individual (craving) and which lead to a typical final state (gratification).  Impulses are then directions of such sources.  The second point of view is the dynamic one.  Its value for representation is undoubtedly very great if the instinct occurrence is to be described in itself and in its various forms.  It fails in the presence of the multiplicity of the instinct life in its various directions.  Every dynamic conception compels us to assume necessarily a single force, that of "a libido" (Jung's desexualised libido).  If, however, it is the same libido that is expressed in all instincts, then a more precise definition of its particular direction becomes necessary, if we wish to understand not only that there is such a thing as once hating, once loving, but also that hostile tendencies may be expressed in friendly actions.  If affects and impulses are not directed by means of ideas, but on the contrary, ideas by affects and impulses, if therefore impulses determine the direction</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0347" prefixused="">346</n></pb>
<p2>of the course of the association, then they must above all be characterised by means of a particular direction.  This, however, can be represented better through the reference to the final conditions typical for each part than through the libido theory that refers everything to the fundamental comparison of a fluid.</p2><p>J. C. FLGEL, B. A., London.  On the Biological Basis of Sexual Repression.</p>
<p>The psychological contrast that is expressed in sexual repression may be considered as a special case of a more general biological contrast.</p>
<p>This contrast permits of two points of view that are closely related to one another.  1. The psychological.  There necessarily exists a reverse relation between the degree of higher organisation and activity of the individual organism on the one hand and of its reproductive energy on the other.  2. The economic.  In consequence of the limited quantity of available nourishment a high level of the individual life results in the control of the number of individual beings, and thereby of the tendencies of reproduction.</p>
<p>Natural selection determined in the course of development the relation of the energy made use of for individuation and for genesis.  In the main, development has brought with it a continual increase of individuation at the cost of genesis; nevertheless there are important influences that have made the advance in that direction slow and difficult.</p>
<p>In mental life the contrast between sexuality and work (sublimation) corresponds with this biological contrast between genesis and individuation.</p>
<p>The sexual impulses up to a certain degree represent an older and more primitive form of the forces of life.  Mankind is constantly endeavouring to adapt itself to a condition in which sublimation plays a greater and the sexual impulses a lesser part.  However, at present a very serious "disharmony" exists in this respect, since the sexual impulses of the human being absorb a greater portion of their entire energy than their present environment requires.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0348" prefixused="">347</n></pb>
<p>The relation between sexuality and sublimation (that is to say between the psychological aspects of genesis and individuation) is complicated; the same energy is in the last instance made use of for both, so that there is no adequate sublimation without strong libido.  Further complications arise through certain factors which render necessary the utilising of certain portions of libidinous energy for sexual purposes throughout life:  1. The actual necessity of reproduction.  2. The slow and gradual construction of the sublimation process.  3. Definite relations between sexual and individual development, in consequence of which a satisfactory adaptation to the non-sexual sides of existence is impossible, as long as a corresponding degree of sexual development is lacking.</p>
<p>The physiological and biological method of consideration of the contrasts between individuation and genesis can only be applied directly in regard to the sexual impulses in so far as these stand in the service of reproduction, but from the psychological point of view the contrast is expressed also in reference to elements of sexuality not serving reproduction, since their energy stands in reverse relationship to the energy given up to sublimation.  Nevertheless the allo-erotic elements succumb in many respects to a greater degree of repression than the auto-erotic ones, with the result that the latter become strengthened at the cost of the former.</p>
<p>The higher stages of individuation are closely bound up with the process of socialisation.  It seems therefore that the sexual repression up to a certain degree can be traced back to the influence of social forces.</p>
<p>A certain degree of inhibition seems to have become a part of the human sexual instinct.  Two important factors are distinguishable.  1. The fact that a strong sexual repression cannot be overcome at once, but only slowly and gradually.  2. The secondary gain of pleasure that can be obtained through the relief of greater tension which repression brings with it.</p>
<p>The general recognition of the facts that are associated with the biological aspect of sexual repression would considerably contribute in removing the greatest difficulties of human existence, as well in the psychological sphere (the sexual conflict) as in the economic sphere (the relation of population to the means of subsistence).</p>

<p>PROF. G. JELGERSMA, Leyden.  A Psycho-Analytical Contribution to the Theory of Feeling.</p>
<p>So far psycho-analysis has supplied few contributions to the theory of feeling.  Freud has briefly alluded to it in a work on a different subject, otherwise there is nothing to be found.  The investigation of the theory of feeling has a large place in the scientific psychological literature.</p>
<p>However, psycho-analysis can also render valuable contributions.  The lecturer gave a short sketch of his theory which approximated to that of Ebbinghaus, and he explained his views from the symptoms of the transference neuroses and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>DR. HANNS SACHS, Vienna.  Day-Dreams in Common.</p>
<p>That the day-dream is a preliminary stage of poetry is one of the most familiar statements of psycho-analysis.  So far it has remained unexplained where one is to look for the cause of the transition from the strict egocentric day-dream, bound to no formal principle, to the work of art that renders enjoyment possible to outsiders through the force of attraction of the aesthetic form.  One had to be satisfied with the psychologically inaccessible factor of the hereditary disposition.</p>
<p>As a stage of transition between day-dream and poetry the "day-dreams in common" come into consideration in which two or more persons cooperate, therefore giving up the limitation to the closest ego-interests.  The analysis of two such cases showed that it was a common feeling of guilt that sought relief and found it in the working out of the day-dream, since in it lay an unconscious admission of the same guilt of the other party.  The feeling of guilt caused the individual personality to appear less prominently in the foreground.</p>
<p>That is the root in the day-dreams in common that in the work of art is the aim unconsciously striven for.  The artistic illusion does not rest on deception of the senses, but in the fact that the receptive person experiences also the affects of the work — consciously as well as unconsciously.  If the poet achieves this illusion, that is to say, if he succeeds in getting the public to regard his work as a work of art, then the public says to him:  "Yes, </p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0350" prefixused="">349</n></pb>
<p2>your forbidden wishes are ours; we desire the same as you desire and have carried out in phantasy"; the public therefore declares itself as being guilty and softens the artist's feeling of guilt.</p2><p>The artist's own person has to step into the background for the sake of the effect of his work.  The narcissism sacrificed thereby is displaced from the author to the work—an ideal fragment of his self—and returns as beauty of form.  In this round-about way the narcissism returns to its original gratification, for the artist now finds personal recognition and interest which otherwise remained denied to the man of phantasy who keeps aloof from action.</p>
<p>It is a postulate of psycho-analysis that at the basis of every great advance of civilisation must lie the repetition of the primitive crime.  This postulate is fulfilled by the above sketched hypothesis.  The day-dream as we know, is built up, in the last instance on the Oedipus complex.  The day-dreamer by yielding to his phantasies repeats the primitive crime—but alone, and this is an offence against the oldest law of mankind, according to which this may be committed only by the whole community of brothers acting together.  The artist finds the way from the insupportable isolation to the brothers and their common guilt.</p>
<p>DR. THEODOR REIK, Vienna.  The strange god and one's own god.</p>
<p>The lecturer began with the point that strange deities and their cult frequently give an uncanny impression.  He endeavoured to explain this effect through the continuity of animistic convictions and for comparison drew parallel cases from the symptomatology of the obsessional neuroses.  The history of religions gives the final explanation of these peculiar reactions of feelings.  The henotheism of the brother clan knew only one god; through the differentiation and local dissemination of mankind it happened that each clan had its own god which was equal to that of the other clan, and like that one was represented as active and effective.  It was only later that the identity of the strange god and one's own god was no longer recognised.  The strange god appeared as</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0351" prefixused="">350</n></pb>
<p2>a caricatured double of one's own god through the advance of civilisation of the one tribe and the falling back of another.  The uncanniness is therefore brought about by means of a returning to individual phases in the developmental history of mankind.  As a second source of the feeling of uncanniness was cited the excitation of feelings from analogy with the infantile complexes arising out of impressions and occurrences of primaeval history.  The uncanniness arising from the primary complexes in the history of mankind proves to be more obstinate than that connected with overcome complexes.  Here for example belong the castration and incest complexes, as well as those feelings originating from the repressed revolutionary impulses.  The pre-existence of the guilty conscience towards one's own god is a determinant for religious persecution (Jewish pogroms, Armenian massacres).  The strange god was once one's own god that was alienated from the masses through the pressure of development and advance of civilisation, and which appears in its cruder and more primitive form now as uncanny.</p2><p>DR. GÉZA RÓHEIM, Budapest.  Central Australian Totemism.</p>
<p>Alcheringa as dream period.  A primitive phase of totemism, as pure wish-fulfilment, is reflected in the traditions of the Arunta.  Eating of the totem and totemistic incest.  The Inapertwa as mythical embryos, the Alcheringa hero as a projection of the omnipotence in the mother's body on to the father's image.</p>
<p>The ignorance of procreation on the part of the Arunta:  a crucial question of social anthropology and an experiment for the psychoanalytic methods of investigation.  Unconscious sexual knowledge that is shown in myths concerning procreation.  Eating as a marriage ceremony and as cause of pregnancy.  The boomerang in the myths of procreation and love magic as penis.  The pre-natal single combat with the father as a cause of birth.  In other words, every birth is unconsciously traced back to incest.  The cause of the ignorance of the Arunta is repression.  This is directed against sexuality in general, because this is unconsciously identified with the Oedipus complex.  The centre of the totem as projection of the body of the mother into the external world.  The Churinga as "another body" or "external soul"—a symbol of the embryo in</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0352" prefixused="">351</n></pb>
<p2>the body of the mother; on account of this is ascribed to it the procreation of children.  (As already noted the Churinga also signifies the penis).  The Arunta theory of the procreation of children is an unconscious infantile wish fulfilment; through it the child becomes its own father and supernatural husband of the mother.</p2><p>The ceremonial of the Central Australian totemism, the Intichiuma rites.  Their performance at the approach of the time of general fruitfulness in nature figures in the traditions as representation and equivalent of coition.  The magic (procreation) and imitative element in the Intichiuma is analysed.  The anthropic significance of the Intichiuma is the Alcheringa:  original aim the propagation of human not animal members of the totem clan.  Intichiumas of the totem of children.  The Intichiuma is the continuation of a prehuman rutting period.  Young men as spectators in the Intichiuma instead of women:  the commencement of repression and homoerotic element in the Intichiuma.  The rutting period is also the time of combat:  the struggle between young and old males must have taken place in the rutting period.  The eating of the totem as a propagation rite is a symbol of the rebellion, but also a symbol of the compact between young and old males.  The connection between the origin of repression and the disappearance of the ruttings periods.  Repression originally directed against the Oedipus complex.  An attempt to determine the phase of development that is represented in the Intichiuma.  Continuation of the analysis of the procreation rites.  The beating of the rock of the Alcheringa hero, a symbolic repetition of the father murder.  Unconscious association between parricide and procreation, since each sexual intercourse occurs with the mother it cannot be completed without first killing the father.  Tearing to pieces and procreation:  parallel characteristics in initiation rites.  The ego and the libido both add their contribution to the development of the Intichiuma rites.</p>
<p>DR. ERNST SIMMEL, Berlin.  Psycho-Analysis of the Gambler.</p>
<p>The treatment of a young man, who in consequence of his passion for gambling was in danger of complete demoralisation and who had several times been in conflict with the police and</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0353" prefixused="">352</n></pb>
<p2>had been sentenced to imprisonment, gave, besides the cure that resulted, a characteristic insight into the genesis and unconscious structure of the passion for gambling itself.</p2><p>It serves the unfolding or the substitute formation of the exceedingly active pre-genital anal-sadistic libido in the unconscious.</p>
<p>The fortune gained and lost at play proved to be much over-determined.</p>
<p>The insatiable inordinate desire that will not rest in the endless vicious circle until the loss becomes gain and the gain once more loss, originates in the narcissistic desire of the anal birth phantasies, to fructify himself, to devour his own excrement, gold, and to give birth to himself out of himself in immeasurable increase, replacing and surpassing his father and mother.  The passion for gambling therefore gratifies ultimately the inclination for the bisexual idea, which the narcissist finds in himself; it serves the compromise formed of man and woman — active and passive — sadism and masochism — and finally the unsettled decision between genital and anal libido, for which the gambler battles in the well known colour symbol, "rouge et noir".  The passion for gambling thus serves auto-erotic gratification, whereby the playing is fore-pleasure, the gaining orgasm, and the loss ejaculation, defecation and castration.</p>
<p>In a brief survey of the historical development of games of chance it was shown that in the individual development of the gamester is repeated, as it were ontogenetically, the phylogenetic formation of the game of chance; that is to say, that on the developmental path of mankind games of chance are a reservoir for the anal-sadistic impulses held in the state of repression.</p>
<p>In conclusion a brief retrospect concerning the psychogenesis of the criminality of the patient was given; and, proceeding from the well known impulse of the criminal to defecate at the place of his misdeed, it was pointed out that the anal-sadistic impulses were effective here in the same sense, whereby the narcissist who is rejected and avoided by the father becomes 'Herostratus".  It is then no longer the Oedipus complex of the perpetrator that determines the tendency to criminality, but the Laios complex of the revenging and punishing father and his imagines, for example, the public prosecutor.</p>

<p>PROF. SIGM. FREUD, Vienna.  Supplements to the Theory of Dreams.</p>
<p>The lecturer in his brief remarks dealt with three points in the theory of dreams.  The first two concerned the theory that the dream is a wish-fulfilment, and certain modifications of this were advanced; the third point referred to a complete corroboration of his rejection of the so-called prospective tendency of the dream.  It was put forward that one had grounds for recognising, besides the well-known wish and anxiety dreams which lent themselves easily to the theory, a third category which he called "punishment dreams".  If one takes into consideration the justified assumption of a special self-observing critical factor in the ego (ego-ideal, censorship, conscience) then these punishment dreams are also to be subsumed under the wish-fulfilment theory, since they represent the wish-fulfilment of this criticising factor.  They have the same relation to the ordinary wish dreams as the symptoms that have arisen from reaction formations in the obsessional neuroses have to hysterical symptoms.  A more serious exception to the rule that the dream is a wish-fulfilment is found in the so-called "traumatic" dreams, as found in patients after accidents, or in the reproductions of forgotten psychic traumata of childhood in the psycho-analysis of neurotics.  In reference to their connection with the wish-fulfilment theory, allusion was made to a work soon to be published called "Jenseits des Lustprinzips".</p>
<p>The mention of an unpublished investigation of Dr. Varendonck of Ghent formed the third point.  Varendonck had found that he was able to bring in a great measure to his conscious observation the unconscious phantasying when half-asleep (called by him "autistic thinking").  It was established that the seeing beforehand of the possibilities of the next day, the preparation of attempts at solution and adaptation, etc., fall quite within the realm of the pre-conscious activity, which produces the latent dream thoughts and as the lecturer had always maintained has nothing to do with the dream work.</p>
<p>DR. S. FERENCZI, Budapest.  Further Extension of the Active Technique in Psycho-Analysis.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0355" prefixused="">354</n></pb>
<p>"Active technique" is only a new name for something that has been constantly used in psycho-analysis.  The cathartic therapy was pronouncedly active; the Freudian psycho-analysis demands from the doctor and the patient before everything else a passive giving up to free associations.  But the interpretation is already an active interference on the part of the doctor.  The only activity that we hitherto demanded from the patient was the overcoming of resistances to ideas.  Another kind of activity was used in certain cases of hysterical phobias.  The patients were urged to re-experience the situation causing the phobia and anxiety and this resulted in advancing the analysis (reminiscences, etc.).  According to Freud the chief rule of the activity is that the cure has to be carried through in abstinence.  In many cases the activity was used in the form of orders and prohibitions, always against the direction of pleasure.  He caused the patients to seek situations that produced discomfort; finally when they became pleasurable to them they were prohibited.  The therapeutic effect in producing further associations was striking.</p>
<p>The indication for the active technique is limited to certain exceptional cases, or to those showing stoppages in the analysis, and its method of use was separately discussed in particular neuroses, character analyses, and at the end of the psycho-analytic cures.  In conclusion attention was drawn to the difference between this activity and the therapeutic measures of others (Jung, Adler, Bjerre), and an attempt was made to construct the theoretical bases of this technique.</p>
<p>EUGENIA SOKOLNICKA, Warsaw.  On the Diagnosis and Symptomatology of the Psycho-Analytical Theory of the Neuroses.</p>

Creation of a new psychology that does not rest on the artificial analyses of the laboratory, but investigates the elementary phenomena of the mind in its work in reality.  Creation of newer concepts on which can be founded the new diagnosis and symptomatology.  Transferring of the main importance to the investigation of the ontogenesis instead of as previously phylogenesis (heredity).  Creation of objective psychological methods of investigation for the functional neuroses in place of the earlier apparently exact physical ones.  Therefore for the petty description of separate symptoms is substituted an extremely fine shading of diagnosis and symptomatology, which enables one to see into the structure of the patient's mind.</p>
<p>Three examples that show the difficulties of an immediately correct and complete diagnosis in many cases, and at the same time the solution of these difficulties by means of psycho-analysis.  Borderline cases with symptoms not quite defined in the earlier sense, are made clear and also capable of cure by psycho-analysis.  Example.  An analysis is from beginning to end the progressive uncovering and interpretation of symptoms.  Examples.  The new conception of the word "symptom".  Character as a symptom.  An example that can serve as a contribution to the question of the rôle of the ego impulses in the formation of symptoms.</p>

<p>DR. GEORG GRODDECK, Baden-Baden.  On the Psycho-Analytic Treatment of Organic Illnesses.</p>
<p>The lecturer sought to prove that factors of censorship exist which permit organic troubles to develop in order to keep repressed material from consciousness.  One invites healthy or sick people to look at the objects on their writing table, to close their eyes and then to name the objects; this or that object will be omitted, and also things that are associated with something repressed.  If the repressed material is too powerful then the censorship is increased rendering the person short-sighted and eventually limits the possibility</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0357" prefixused="">356</n></pb>
<p2>of seeing through congestion of the blood vessels of the eyes.  The process is the same in the visceral sphere as the formation of antitoxine by the organism through intoxication or of fever and suppuration through infection.</p2><p>If the repressed material is produced or its affective content set free, then the congestion is unnecessary and can be given up.  They can; they need not.  The same thing is valid for all spheres of life of the organism.  Examples were quoted.</p>
<p>DR. L. BINSWANGER, Kreuzlingen.  Psycho-Analysis and Clinical Psychiatry.</p>
<p>An attempt to compare the two directions of investigation with each other in their fundamental concepts.  This is done at first by means of the individual disease concepts of psychiatry with more especial consideration of the most recent views in the sphere of characterology (Kretschmer), and that by means of the three conceptual layers which form the system of psycho-analysis, namely, the pure psychological investigation or that of the personality, the dynamic-qualitative, and the biological-teleological methods of consideration.  The differences were then examined that exist between psycho-analysis and psychiatry with respect to the concept of disease and health, the concept of cure and diagnosis.  In conclusion the psycho-analytical direction of investigation as a system moulding mental and psychical phenomena into a unitary entity from the point of view of performance was contrasted with psychiatry as a conglomerate connected together only by its practical tasks.</p>
<p>DR. A. STÄRCKE, Den Dolder, Holland.  The Relations between Neuroses and Psychoses.</p>
<p>Both categories have their root in the relative damming up of the libido, infantile fixations, and ambivalency, as Freud has shown in the case of the neuroses.  The difference between the two groups is a quantitative one.  The boundary is dependent on the stage of development or regression of the social civilisation.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0358" prefixused="">357</n></pb>
<p>The criterion of the lay conception of mental disease lies in the over-development of behaviour (including speech) on the part of those who are mentally ill, which destroys the normal repression.  In both groups the regression of the libido and ego impulses can extend to the lowest stages.  The regression in the neuroses concerns in general small quantities.  The reconstruction in the neuroses is a compromise; its result in the psychoses stands in general on a lower level both for the libido and ego impulses.</p>
<p>The obsessional neurosis takes a medial-position between psychosis and neurosis.  The regression of the ego impulses proceeds parallel to that of the libido.  It is not the narcissistic regression in itself that determines the constitutional disposition in the psychoses, but the fixation of the lower level.  This fixation often goes together with some libidinous gratification of the lower level.</p>
<p>The differences between the symptoms are conditioned, apart from the depth of regression, also by the distribution of the libido over parts of the body.  The psychotic breaking through of the censorship is conditioned by abnormally strong pleasure in thinking.  Organic increase of libido plays a greater part in the psychoses.  Organic inpoverishment of the libido is responsible for the schizophrenic pseudo-dementia.  The four Freudian types of neurotic sickness occur also in the psychoses.  In addition psychoses often follow infantile wish-fulfilments (for example, death of a relative, perverse practice rendered possible).</p>
<p>A guiding influence in the reconstruction of society belongs to Freudianism.</p>
<p>O. PFISTER, Zürich.  The Significance of Psycho-Analysis for Constitutional Law and Political Economy.</p>
<p>The lecturer showed how the prevailing folk psychology, since it recognises totemism as the point of departure of the formation of the state, was forced to face a riddle that was insoluble by its means, while Freud through his studies on living people was able to make intelligible from a unitary point of view the different characteristics of totemism, namely, the ambivalent treatment of the totem as an object of anxiety and as a protecting spirit, the prohibition of killing, the sacramental meal, and the connection with exogamy.  The choice of plants as totem was illustrated by</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0359" prefixused="">358</n></pb>
<p2>aversions to the use of vegetable foods, by means of a phobia against plucking flowers, and by the drawings of a boy fourteen years old who expressed unconsciously his sexual wishes in drawings of plants.</p2><p>Unconscious roots of the different constitutions of a state were shown in the day-dreams of two brothers, of whom one resembled his father and was a monarchist, while the other took after his mother and preferred republicanism.  The father complexes of Bismarck and Bebel expressed themselves in monarchism and state socialism, and also the anarchist remains attached to the father.  The Irishman often hates in England the father, as he loves in Ireland the mother.  In a patient of Ernst Schneider the separation of church and state became the centre of his interest as soon as the divorce of his parents became acute.</p>
<p>The importance of psychology of the unconscious for the normal life of the state, for war and revolution, was only touched upon.</p>
<p>In the second part the life of society was referred to and especially the psychology of capitalism.  Max Weber finds the sources of capitalism chiefly explained in the doctrinal thought of Calvin, but did not explain how this theory could be maintained in contradiction to the New Testament and its prohibition of riches, and how also Calvin's demand to place gold in the service of God was abandoned.  From the analyses of living people it is proved that the spirit of capitalism everywhere, and also in Calvinism, presupposes repression of love.  Thereby may be discovered analytically in pathological capitalistic predispositions the Oedipus attitude against the father, narcissism, anal-erotism, castration reactions or sadistic masochistic impulses.  The results as regards religion, ethics and society correspond with the processes in the obsessional neuroses.  Capitalism without religion, frequently to be understood as desublimation, bears in itself the germ of the struggle of all against all, as does political imperialism.</p>
<p>Thus in consequence of the despising of the law of love, the tragedy of Peer Gynt is repeated in the life of society, and the curse of the Nibelung is fulfilled.</p>
<p>DR. SABINA SPIELREIN, Lausanne.  On the Question of the Origin and Development of Speech.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0360" prefixused="">359</n></pb>
<p>Autistic speech which is not intended for communication and understanding of other people is distinguished from "social speaking".  Autistic speech is the primary one.  Spielrein considers that singing and words, <i>i. e.</i> speaking aloud, essentially belong to social speech.  Likewise there are the "social" or "sociable" arts, such as music and poetry, which explains their high popularity.  Theories of the origin of speech were analysed.  The question was especially considered whether the child itself invents language and to what are traced back the childish "alteration of words".  The mechanisms that are supposed to be the origin of the first words, Mama and Papa, were investigated and supported by observations of others; the lecturer traced them back to the act of sucking.  These words are the bearers of pleasure which the child experiences in the act of sucking, and to them may be attributed the enormous significance of the first wish-fulfilment in phantasy, because here the wish, directed on to an external object, cannot be gratified whenever desired.  In consequence of the pleasurable sensation communicated at first in the act of sucking by means of another living being, the child perceives the idea of an external and pleasure-bringing object, for which one longs and which can be fetched by the calling out of the wish word derived from the act of sucking.  In this way originated the first forms of social speech, which at the same time are signs of communication between the ego and the external world, therefore signs of expression of the germinating hetero-erotism.</p>
<p>The relations between word-formation and memory of the childish feelings were discussed and examples given showing that the childish formation of words and sentences or an alteration of both could be explained, amongst other ways, from the adaption to the new psychological phase of development, assimilation to the old and decay corresponding with subconscious elaboration.</p>
<p>DR. MARGARETE STEGMANN, Dresden.  Form and Content in Psycho-Analysis.</p>
<p>Content is the complex, the substance of the occurrence, the "What" of the neurosis.  Under form is to be understood the nature, the "How" of the occurrence, the mental structure that is expressed in it.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0361" prefixused="">360</n></pb>
<p>The contents are not only the same in all neuroses, they can be constantly demonstrated in the healthy.  The form is typically different and within the bounds of certain types individually distinct, so that in spite of the similarity of the contents each case for analysis is something new and peculiar to itself.</p>
<p>Besides the content it is also important to pay full attention to the form and the principle of mental activity in the patient.  Freud, who is not only the father but also the classic of analysis, has dealt in a masterly manner with these two aspects of the subject of the analysis.  Though observation of the contents, the grouping of complexes, is important and necessary for scientific investigation, for the further extension of the system of Freud's theories the lecturer has found very fruitful for therapeutic practice a closer consideration of the individual law of form.  A few examples from analyses were quoted.</p>
<p>The uncovering of the contents by means of the bringing up of complexes from the unconscious, from the spheres of feeling and of the irrational, aims at making them accessible to the influence of reason and conviction.  What effects this is consciousness.</p>
<p>The recognising and making conscious of the law of form raises the forces (impulses) from the lower stage of their objectivation to the higher one of conscious formation.  The analysis has to deliver the patient from the material state of bondage to a spiritual state in which the contents, the material, is not denied and forced (suppressed), but was further in organisation.</p>
<p>DR. HERMINE HUG-HELLMUTH, Vienna.  On the technique of the analysis of children.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of the childish mind and its relation to the environment needs a special technique of analysis.  Such an analysis can only be carried out in children over six to seven years of age; in younger ones only a psycho-analytical education can take place.</p>
<p>It is advisable to treat children in their home and accustomed surroundings, and not to have them lying down, as this position is connected by the child with phantasies of being overpowered or seduced.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0362" prefixused="">361</n></pb>
<p>From seven to eight years of age play has often to form the bridge for treatment; in older children it is useful to tell of the tricks of other children as a good introduction to analysis.  Since the analyst is oriented by the parents concerning the "naughtiness" of the child one need not be afraid of "corrupting" the patient through such communications.</p>
<p>Positive transference is brought about as a rule in the very first hours, and is immediately played off against the parents; hence it is necessary to explain to the parents the significance of the transference, so that the parental love does not suffer too much from the apparent turning away of their child.  The negative transference is clothed in the form of constant fear of betrayal by the analyst to the parents.  The discussion of sexual questions requires special tact; here besides a strong and trustful attachment of the child there frequently appear tendencies arising out of an over-great repression, namely, the impulse to humiliate the analyst.</p>
<p>Great use can be made of free associations in youthful patients; dreams also furnish valuable material from the unconscious.  The analysis of children leads to the knowledge that in the child there exists another layer in the unconscious, another distribution of the systems conscious and pre-conscious, than in adults.</p>
<p>The relation of the analyst to the parents is a difficult chapter in the analysis of youthful patients.  His chief task towards them is to keep them from actively participating in the treatment, and to get them to recognise that their only cooperation lies in patience and toleration.  The parents have to recognise that they ought to demand of their mentally sick child just as little as regards learning as in a child suffering physically.</p>
<p>I have not yet seen an analysis of children fail on account of the resistance of the young patient, but more than one on account of the resistance of the parents.</p>
