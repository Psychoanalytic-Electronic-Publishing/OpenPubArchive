        <p>In a recent radio talk<ftnx r="F001">1</ftnx>, I reflected on the following points: that
            Freud was one of the most talked about and least read figures of all time; that the
            interest in him far exceeds the interest in what he wrote; that what Freud thought and
            said has influenced the twentieth century incomparably less than the misconceptions by
            which discovery gives way to demotic notion; and that this transmogrification is matched
            only by the failure to understand what psychoanalytic therapy really amounts to.</p>
        <p>The assertions underlying these reflections cannot be expected to stand without
            supporting argument, but they were prompted by the appearance of three recent books. The
            first of these is yet another biography, this time by Peter Gay. The plethora of source
            material is fully acknowledged in a bibliographical essay that forms an indispensable
            appendix to Gay's biography. There he observes that ‘the secondary literature on Freud
            is vast, rapidly growing, almost out of control. Some of the avalanche is revealing,
            much of it is useful, more of it provocative; an astonishing share is malicious or
            downright absurd.’ Like others before him, Gay was seriously handicapped in his
            endeavour. Freud deliberately set out to make the lot of any future biographer as
            difficult as possible. He destroyed papers, letters and notes, saying, after one such
            instance: ‘Let the biographers labour and toil, we won't make it easy for them’: and
            when, following the Anschluss, he was about to leave Vienna, he threw away valuable
            material rescued only through the diligence of Anna Freud and Princess Marie Bonaparte.
            In a letter to Arnold Zweig, quoted by Gay, Freud declared: ‘Anyone who writes a
            biography is committed to lies, concealments, hypocrisy, flattery and even to hiding his
            own lack of understanding, for biographical truth does not exist, and if it did we could
            not use it.’</p>
