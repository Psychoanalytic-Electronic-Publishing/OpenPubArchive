<p>Karen Horney, a Neo-Freudian analyst who immigrated from Germany to the USA, undertook the difficult task of developing a theory that remained concrete psychology without resorting to biology or to metapsychological entelechies. Although her basic construct, as in Freud, is a conflict between nature and culture, nature for her is the naturally endowed <i>real self,</i> which the neurotic abandons bowing to cultural pressures. This process of desertion is teleological and based on imagination, and is also creative. It entails the pursuit of a god-like <i>idealized image</i> of the self shaped according to narrow and despoiled values. Being interpersonal, Horney's theory avoids third-person objectification which creates a false distance; it thus remains (inter)subjective. A theory of interpersonal affect, it is dramatic before being dynamic. It also abandons claims to universality as it does to the “objectivity” of the natural sciences. Horney's focus on <i>alienation</i> brings her close to Hegel and Marx, a neglected fact, and she pioneered feminist and self-help theories. The difficulty in reading Horney is not her abstruseness, since her theory refuses technicism. It resides rather in that resistance created by what Althusser called <i>interpellation:</i> one feels her finger pointed at oneself as one reads.</p>

        <p>It is only during the Romantic Revolution that affect really achieves a place in
            philosophy. The Romantics protest the arid hegemony that reason has exerted up to Kant.
            They advocate for a new approach to embrace the totality of man in a scientific
            equation. Feeling, language, art, passion, dreaming, even madness must be included <bx
