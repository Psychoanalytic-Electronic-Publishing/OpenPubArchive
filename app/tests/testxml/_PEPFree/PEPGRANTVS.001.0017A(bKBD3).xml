        <p>Inspired by reports of unusually vivid dreaming during the first Covid-19 lockdown, a small group of postgraduate students at the UCL Psychoanalysis Unit were inspired to start collecting Lockdown Dreams, forming the basis for this series of films. In this third instalment, we asked an international group of psychoanalysts to reflect on their experience of dreams during the pandemic.</p>

        <p>MARTIN GAUTHIER: Here, the lockdown was certainly a shock. It was a narcissistic blow,
            putting the ego in crisis. </p>
        <p>LIZ ALLISON: Freud thought that psychoanalysis was responsible for dealing the third of
            three major blows to human narcissism. After Copernicus had shown that the sun does not
            revolve around the Earth, and Darwin had revealed our descent from the apes, our dreams
            serve as constant reminders of the third painful blow, perhaps the hardest of the three,
            that the ego is not master in its own house. During the pandemic, the disturbances
            caused by these night visitors became more frequent, more vivid, and often more
            upsetting. However, when we decided to start collecting specimens of lockdown dreams, we
            discovered that many people were very pleased to be offered an opportunity to share
            them. </p>
        <p>RUDI VERMOTE: As analysts, we are used to listening to dreams as part of a process over
            time, reflecting the inner world of a patient. This project, however, is unique. It
            presents many dreams without any background of the patient, but all the dreams are
            related to COVID. </p>
        <p>LIZ ALLISON: There have been other examples of collections of dreams, both before and
            after Freud. </p>
        <p>DANIEL PICK: I think Jesuits in the 17th century collected dreams from various far-flung
            parts of the world. And there's a long history of collecting dreams, I think, in the
            hope that it would tell the researcher something important. So, there's something, I
            think, that is interesting to just think about the timing of when researchers and
            academics as well as psychoanalysts return to the fundamental question of our dream
            life. </p>
        <p>LIZ ALLISON: In the past, collections of dreams have often been motivated by deeply
            unwelcome and disturbing experiences that feel impossible to process. </p>
        <p>DANIEL PICK: These kinds of collective dream projects often seem to come out of periods
            of conflict and obvious political and social disturbance. So, in the aftermath of the
            Second World War and in the early Cold War, there seemed to be, also, this interest in
            gathering collective experiences of dreams. </p>
