        <p><i>Free Associations</i> is the 15th in the Radical Science series at the same time that
            it is the pilot issue of a new journal of the same name with the subtitle:
                <i>Psychoanalysis, Groups, Politics, Culture</i>.</p>
        <p>The need for a journal on the wider cultural relations of psychoanalysis, psychotherapy
            and psychology has been felt for a long time. Indeed, <i>Free Associations</i> revives a
            way of thinking about psychoanalysis which was widespread in the pre-World War II period
            and which has been eclipsed by professionalisation and sectarianism.</p>
        <p>The idea for a journal grew out of the work of the Radical Science Collective as part of
            a wider project, critically to examine science, technology, medicine and other forms of
            expertise and to make them more accessible and publicly accountable. It has been a
            central feature of our radical science approach to argue that a space must be made for
            reflexivity and subjectivity in scientific culture. For it is a consequence of the very
            scientism which insulates the objects of knowledge from their human sources that a
            polarisation has occurred between traditional perspectives. That is, Marxism has become
            the critique of social and economic forces and structures, and psychoanalysis the
            attempt to reclaim the individual subject. There has been an implicit recognition within
            both traditions of their limitations â€” in the attempt to find a subject in Marx's early
            work on alienation and in the attempt to understand the social resonances of
            intrapsychic conflicts in psychoanalysis. Both cultures have tried to find ways of
            expressing the unresolvable conflicts within a whole which gives them meaning and
            hope.</p>
