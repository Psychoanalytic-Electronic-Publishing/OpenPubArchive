<p class="abs">To warrant the relevance, if any, of Freud's psychoanalytic edifice to the 21st century, its supporters must endeavor, if at all possible, to find genuine evidence for its major pillars or to modify them significantly in response to emerging new evidence. Such a quest must begin with a clear understanding of the range and depth of the <span class="i">failure</span> of Freud's cardinal clinical arguments. I endeavor below to provide such comprehension by laying bare the epistemological gravamen in the case of each of his principal tenets. And I argue that neither the post-Freudian formulations of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> nor its so-called &#8220;hermeneutic&#8221; <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yp0008360089310" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">reconstruction</span> has succeeded in vindicating the psychoanalytic enterprise.</p>  </div>

That number is declining while the mean age of the analysts is 62 and increasing.

<p class="body">For well over a century, the bulk of the psychoanalytic community has complacently squandered and recklessly forfeited its erstwhile near monopoly: No genuine effort was made to procure the required cogent evidence for the credibility of Freud's causal inferences and explanations in psychopathology, <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0015102990380" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychotherapy</span>, <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001d.yp0010931565630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">dream</span> theory, theory of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yp0019680781350" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychosexual development</span>, and theory of slips.</p>  
<p class="pagebreak"><a name="p0258"></a>- 257 -</p>  
<p class="body">Alas, the recent responses of mainstream <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> and of its apologists contribute further to its stagnation and even decadence.</p>  
<p class="body">Thus, the philosopher Peter Caws tries to snatch victory from the jaws of scientific defeat. Speaking of my epistemological critique of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> (Gr&#252;nbaum, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0045" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1984</span>, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0048" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1993</span>, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0051" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">2002</span>), <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0013" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Caws (2003)</span> writes &#8220;&#8230;it might be that everything Gr&#252;nbaum said was completely brilliant and right, but that it was also completely beside the point&#8221; (p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=ppsy.020.0618a#p0624">624</a>). Instead, Caws offers the altogether elusive program of &#8220;reconceptualizing <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> as a set of local theories (metatheoretically linked) applicable to idiosyncratic cases. Every patient is a new world, whose laws it is the task of the analyst to establish and apply&#8221; (p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=ppsy.020.0618a#p0618">618</a>). But how, I ask, can the analyst possibly hope to &#8220;establish&#8221; the allegedly &#8220;idiosyncratic&#8221; causal &#8220;laws&#8221; governing the genesis of a <span class="i">singular</span> <a name="hit3"></a><span class="searchhit">patient's</span> psychopathology? Alas, Caws' merely programmatic <span class="i">ipse dixit</span> (p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=ppsy.020.0618a#p0619">619</a>) does not even begin to come to grips with this challenge and cries out for at least one specific example. Besides, this challenge is not predicated at all on Caws' red herring of &#8220;physics envy&#8221; (p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=ppsy.020.0618a#p0620">620</a>). As the reader will see from my essay below, Caws irresponsibly caricatured my critique of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span>, when he manufactured a straw man evasively: &#8220;<span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0048" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Gr&#252;nbaum (1993)</span> takes the straight <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0017868339590" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">philosophy</span>-of-physics line and demolishes Freud with heavy artillery&#8221; (p. 624).</p>  
<p class="body">As against Caws' phantom, note that ever since Francis Bacon four centuries ago, it has been clear that <span class="i">there is nothing at all endemic to physics</span> in the requirements for the validation of <span class="i">causal</span> hypotheses, with which psychoanalytic theory and therapy are replete. And I demanded the fulfillment of just these entirely legitimate epistemological and methodological requirements when I argued that the principal tenets of the Freudian corpus, which are causal, have not been validated even a century after their enunciation. Besides, causal hypotheses are also avowedly indispensable to Caws' fancied version of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span>. Moreover, his <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0014788201080" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">conception</span> of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> misguidedly patronizes Freud, when he tells us with complacent elusiveness: &#8220;&#8230;perhaps <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> wasn't something built on a foundation by Freud, even though he thought it was&#8230;it could best be thought of as a scaffolding that might enable other people to build something&#8221; (Caws, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0013" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">2003</span>, p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=ppsy.020.0618a#p0624">624</a>).</p>  
<p class="body">Yet how, I ask, can Caws see himself as implementing his evisceration and emasculation of Freud's edifice in the face of declaring: &#8220;The explanandum to be explained will be the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptom</span> that brought the patient into analysis in the first place, the explanans [the explainor] will draw its <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001m.yn0018787855710" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">material</span> mainly from <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0015567349630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">the unconscious</span>&#8221; (p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=ppsy.020.0618a#p0619">619</a>). This excruciatingly unhelpful statement of an explanans as drawing &#8220;its <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001m.yn0018787855710" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">material</span> from <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0015567349630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">the unconscious</span>&#8221; plainly <span class="i">cries out</span> for concrete illustration by at least one specific case <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yn0016059068310" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">history</span>! How, for example, can Caws' appeal to such an explanans hope to dispense at all with Freud's <span class="i">generalization</span> that <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span> is pathogenic? Indeed, as Freud rightly told us foundation-ally: &#8220;The theory of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span> is the cornerstone on which the whole <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yn0021397840800" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">structure</span> of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> rests. It is the most essential part of it&#8221; (Freud, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0024" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1914/1957a</span>, p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.014.0001a#p0016">16</a>). It seems that with friends like Caws, <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> needs no enemies.</p>  
<p class="body">Equally unsuccessfully, in a 2004 article, the Australian philosopher Douglas Kirsner exhorts psychoanalysts to engage in &#8220;the exciting method of philosophical probing of the human mind and the nature of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yp0007772036560" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">human nature</span>&#8221; (p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.014.0339a#p0339">339</a>). But how can analysts do such probing without empirical tests? As I have shown <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0051" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">(Gr&#252;nbaum, 2002)</span>, Freud's investigative method of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> does not possess the required probative capabilities at all. Thus, Kirsner's utopian exhortation rests on quicksand.</p>  
<p class="body">Besides, despite Freud's own clear commitment to validating his hypotheses by familiar standards of evidence, he is <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yn0015659043440" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">being</span> misportrayed as a crypto-hermeneuticist and litterateur.</p>  
<p class="pagebreak"><a name="p0259"></a>- 258 -</p>  
<p class="body">Alas, a low point in the contemporary psychoanalytic literature is Elisabeth Roudi-nesco's book <span class="i">Why Psychoanalysis?</span> (<span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0063" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1999</span>; <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0064" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">2001</span>). Very regrettably, it is marked by a primitive incomprehension of the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0017868339590" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">philosophy</span> of science, by egregious straw men, as well as by personal abuse of those whose views she deplores, myself included, labeling me &#8220;the principal U.S. representative of scientistically inspired anti-Freudianism&#8221; (chap. 7, p. 74). But she does not deign to come to grips with any of my criticisms of Freud's ideas. Nor is she equipped to do so.</p>  
<p class="body">What are the future prospects of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span> in the 21st century?

<p class="body">By now, the psychoanalytic enterprise has completed more than its first century. Thus, the time has come to take thorough <span class="i">critical</span> stock of its past performance qua theory of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yp0007772036560" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">human nature</span> and therapy, as well as to have a look at its prospects.</p>  
<p class="body">It is important to distinguish between the validity of Freud's work qua <span class="i">psychoanalytic</span> theoretician, and the merits of his earlier work, which would have done someone else proud as the achievement of a lifetime. Mark Solms has edited and translated a forthcoming four-volume series, <span class="i">The Complete Neuroscientific Works of Sigmund Freud</span> (London: Karnac). One focus of these writings is the neurological <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011615574840" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">representation</span> of mental functioning; another is Freud's discovery of the essential morphological and physiological unity of the nerve cell and fiber. They also contain contributions to basic neuroscience such as the histology of the nerve cell, neuronal function, and neurophysiology. As a clinical neurologist, Freud wrote a major monograph on <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001a.yn0016576558680" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">aphasia</span>  <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0072" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">(Solms &amp; Saling, 1990)</span>. As the editors pointed out in the preview &#8220;An Introduction to the Neuroscientific Works of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0005894352170" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">Sigmund Freud</span>&#8221; in <span class="i">The Pre-Psychoanalytic Writings of Sigmund Freud</span>  <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0077" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">(Van de Vijver, G. &amp; Geerardyn, F., 2002)</span>, Freud wrote major papers on cerebral palsy that earned him the status of a world <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001a.yp0001556735140" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">authority</span>.

Furthermore, Freud was one of the founders of neuropsychopharmacology. For instance, he did scientific work on the properties of cocaine that benefited perhaps from his own use of that drug. Alas, that intake may well also account for some of the abandon featured by the more bizarre and grandiose of his psychoanalytic forays.</p>  
<p class="body">As Solms has remarked (personal <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0000606445570" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">communication</span>, 1995), it is an irony of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yn0016059068310" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">history</span> that Freud, the psychoanalyst who postulated the ubiquity of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yp0007043286960" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">bisexuality</span> in humans, started out by deeming himself a <span class="i">failure</span> for having had to conclude that eels are indeed bisexual. In a quest to learn how they reproduce, one of Freud's teachers of histology and anatomy assigned him the task of finding the hitherto elusive testicles of the eel as early as 1877, when he was 21 years old. After having dissected a lobular organ in about 400 specimens in Trieste, Freud found that this organ apparently had the properties of an ovary no less than those of a testicle. <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yn0015659043440" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">Being</span> unable to decide whether he had found the ever elusive testicles, Freud inferred that he had failed, as he reported in a rueful 1877 paper.</p>  
<p class="body">In 1880, Freud published a (free) translation of some of J. S.

<p class="body">Naturally, I sympathize with Sch&#252;ttauf and his coworkers in their avowed effort to escape my criticism (Gr&#252;nbaum, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0045" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1984</span>, pp. 202-205) of an earlier purported experimental confirmation of Freud's theory of slips by <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0059" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Motley (1980)</span>. I had complained that the independent variable Motley manipulated in his <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yn0006357211040" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">speech</span>-<span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001e.yn0004110074470" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">error</span> experiments did <span class="i">not</span> involve <span class="i">unconscious</span> antecedents&#8212;but only <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0005451837790" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">conscious</span> ones. As Sch&#252;ttauf, Bredenkamp, and Specht tell us, precisely to escape my criticism of Motley, they relied on Freud's etiology of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001o.yp0017700482100" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">obsessive-compulsive neurosis</span> to infer that subjects who exhibit the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span> of that <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yp0013496709810" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">neurosis</span> fulfill the requirement of harboring repressions of anal-sadistic wishes. Thus, <span class="i">only</span> on that etiologic assumption does their use of compulsive subjects <span class="i">and</span> their manipulation of words pertaining to anal-sadistic themata warrant their expectation of a higher incidence of verbal slips in this group than among normals.</p>  
<p class="body">Surely one could not reasonably expect the authors themselves to have carried out empirical tests of the etiology on which their entire investigation is <span class="i">crucially predicated.</span> Nonetheless, Eysenck's <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001d.yp0007446770570" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">demand</span> for such evidence is entirely appropriate: Without independent <span class="i">supporting</span> evidence for that etiology, their test is definitely not a test of Freud's theory of slips of the tongue, let alone&#8212;as they conclude&#8212;a confirmation of it.</p>  
<p class="body">Thus, as long as good empirical support for the Freudian scenario is unavailable, we actually don't know whether any bona fide Freudian slips exist at all. Just this lack of evidence serves to undermine Nagel's thesis that cultural influence is a criterion of validity. After all, if we have no cogent evidence for the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001e.yp0017512081750" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">existence</span> of genuinely Freudian slips, then Freud's theory of bungled actions (parapraxes) might well be false. And if so, it would not contribute to its validity even if our entire <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yp0000323326390" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">culture</span> unanimously believed in it and made extensive explanatory use of it: When an ill-supported theory is used to provide explanations, they run the grave risk of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yn0015659043440" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">being</span> bogus, and its purported insights may well be <span class="i">pseudo</span> -insights.</p>  
<p class="body">A second example supporting my rejection of Nagel's cultural criterion is furnished by</p>  
<p class="pagebreak"><a name="p0265"></a>- 264 -</p>  
<p class="body_cont">the work of the celebrated art historian Meyer Schapiro of Columbia University. Schapiro saw himself as greatly influenced by Freud in his accounts of the work of such painters as Paul C&#233;zanne, who died in 1906 <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0073" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">(Solomon, 1994)</span>. Of course, Schapiro never actually put C&#233;zanne on the psychoanalytic couch. But he subjected artists indirectly &#8220;to his own [brand of speculative] couch treatment&#8221; <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0073" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">(Solomon, 1994)</span>.

<p class="body">But if apples are held to symbolize sex unconsciously for C&#233;zanne or anyone else, why doesn't <span class="i">anything else</span> that resembles apples in <span class="i">some</span> respect (e.g., <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yn0015659043440" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">being</span> quasi-spherical) do likewise?

<p class="body">Let me now turn to my critique of the core of Freud's original psychoanalytic theory and to a verdict on its fundamental modifications by two major post-Freudian sets of hypotheses called <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0004708039940" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">self psychology</span> and <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001o.yn0010361003460" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">object relations</span> theory.</p>  
<p class="body">The pillars of the avowed &#8220;cornerstone&#8221; of Freud's theoretical edifice comprise several major theses: (1) Distressing mental states induce the operation of a psychic mechanism of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span>, which consists in the banishment from <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0004696678820" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">consciousness</span> of <span class="i">unpleasurable</span> psychic states (Freud, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0025" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1915/1957b</span>, p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.014.0141a#p0147">147</a>); (2) Once <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span> is operative (more or less fully), it not only banishes such negatively charged ideas from <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0004696678820" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">consciousness</span>, but plays a <span class="i">further</span> crucial multiple causal role: It is <span class="i">causally necessary</span> for the pathogens of neuroses, the production of our <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001d.yp0010931565630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">dreams</span>, and the generation of our various sorts of slips (bungled actions); and (3) The &#8220;method of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span>&#8221; can identify and lift (undo) the <a name="hit6"></a><span class="searchhit">patient's</span> repressions; by doing so, it can identify the pathogens of the neuroses, and the generators of our <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001d.yp0010931565630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">dreams</span>, as well as the causes of our motivationally opaque slips; moreover, by lifting the pathogenic repressions, <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> functions therapeutically, rather than only investigatively. It is to be understood that the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yp0013496709810" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">neurotic</span>  <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span> above are linked to <span class="i">unsuccessful</span> repressions, <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yn0015659043440" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">being</span> &#8220;compromise&#8221; formations as explained below.</p>  
<p class="body">Freud provided two sorts of arguments for his cardinal etiologic doctrine that repressions are the pathogens of the neuroses: His earlier one, which goes back to his original collaboration with <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yp0021265060230" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">Josef Breuer</span>, relies on purported <span class="i">therapeutic successes</span> from lifting repressions; the later one, designed to show that the pathogenic repressions are sexual, is drawn from presumed reenactments (&#8220;transferences&#8221;) of infantile episodes in the adult <a name="hit7"></a><span class="searchhit">patient's</span> interactions with the analyst during psychoanalytic treatment.</p>  
<p class="body">It will be expositorily expeditious to deal with Freud's earlier etiologic argument below, and to appraise the subsequent one, which goes back to his &#8220;Dora&#8221; case <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yn0016059068310" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">history</span> of 1905, after that.

Thomas Gilovich, a professor of psychology at Cornell University, is now doing valuable work on the conditions under which painful experiences are <span class="i">remembered</span> and on those <span class="i">other</span> conditions under which they are forgotten.</p>  
<p class="body">The numerous and familiar occurrences of vivid and even obsessive recall of negative experiences pose a fundamental <span class="i">statistical</span> and explanatory challenge to Freud that neither he nor his followers have ever met. We must ask <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0049" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">(Gr&#252;nbaum, 1994)</span>: Just what is the <span class="i">ratio</span> of the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0016695385550" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">forgetting</span> of distressing experiences to their recall, and what other factors determine</p>  
<p class="pagebreak"><a name="p0268"></a>- 267 -</p>  
<p class="body_cont">that ratio? Freud gave no statistical evidence for assuming that <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0016695385550" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">forgetting</span> them is the <span class="i">rule</span> and <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yp0021134845400" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">remembering</span> them is the exception. Yet, as we can see, his theory of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span> is devastatingly undermined from the outset if forgettings of negative experiences do not greatly outnumber rememberings statistically. After all, if <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0016695385550" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">forgetting</span> is not the rule, then what <span class="i">other</span> reason does Freud offer for supposing that when distressing experiences are actually forgotten, these forgettings are instances of genuine <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span> because of affective displeasure? And if he has no such other reason, then, <span class="i">a fortiori</span>, he has no basis at all for his pivotal etiologic scenario that forbidden or aversive states of mind are usually repressed and thereby <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0004867612400" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">cause</span> compromise formations.</p>  
<p class="body">Astonishingly, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0034" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Freud (1916/1961b)</span> thinks he can parry this basic statistical and explanatory challenge by an evasive dictum, as follows: &#8220;Mental life is the arena and battle-ground for mutually opposing purposes [of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0016695385550" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">forgetting</span> and <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yp0021134845400" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">remembering</span>]&#8230;there is room for both.

Indeed, just that question cries out for an answer from Freud if he is to make his case. Instead, he cavalierly left it to dangle epistemologically in limbo.</p>

<p class="body">Another basic difficulty, which besets all three major branches of the theory of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span> alike, lies in the epistemological defects of Freud's so-called <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yn0000889846690" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">fundamental rule</span> of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span>, the supposed microscope and X-ray tomograph of the human mind. This rule enjoins the patient to tell the analyst without reservation whatever comes to mind. Thus, it serves as the fundamental method of clinical investigation. We are told that by using this <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0012766571790" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">technique</span> to unlock the floodgates of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0015567349630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">the unconscious</span>, Freud was able to show that neuroses, <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001d.yp0010931565630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">dreams</span>, and slips are caused by repressed motives. Just as in Breuer's cathartic use of hypnosis, it is a cardinal thesis of Freud's entire psychoanalytic enterprise that his method of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> has a twofold major capability, which is both investigative and therapeutic: (1) It can <span class="i">identify</span>  <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0015567349630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">the unconscious</span> causes of human thoughts and <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yp0012983181060" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">behavior</span>, both abnormal and normal; and (2) By overcoming resistances and lifting repressions, it can remove <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0015567349630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">the unconscious</span> pathogens of neuroses and thus provide therapy for an important class of mental disorders.</p>  
<p class="body">But on what grounds did Freud assert that <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> has the stunning investigative capability to be <span class="i">causally probative</span> for etiologic research in psychopathology?

As compared to fathoming the causation of major somatic diseases, that seems almost miraculous, <span class="i">if at all true</span>. Freud tells us very clearly (Freud <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0030" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1900/1958c</span>, p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.004.r0009a#p0528">528</a>) that his argument for his investigative tribute to <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> as a means of uncovering the causation of neuroses is, at bottom, a <span class="i">therapeutic</span> one going back to the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yp0020836498980" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">cathartic method</span> of treating <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yp0003548993690" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">hysteria</span>. Let me state and articulate his argument.</p>  
<p class="body">One of Freud's justifications for the use of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> as a <span class="i">causally probative</span> method of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001d.yp0010931565630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">dream</span> investigation leading to the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001i.yp0016277282680" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">identification</span> of the repressed <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001d.yp0010931565630" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">dream</span> thoughts, he tells us, is that it &#8220;is identical with the procedure [of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span>] by which we resolve hysterical <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span>; and there the correctness of our method [of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span>] is warranted by the coincident emergence and disappearance of the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span>&#8221; (p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.004.r0009a#p0528">528</a>) But, as I have pointed out elsewhere (Gr&#252;nbaum, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0048" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1993</span>, pp. 25-26), his original German text here contains a confusing slip of the pen.

Yet Strachey translated Freud correctly as having spoken of &#8220;the coincident emergence and disappearance of the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span>.&#8221; It would seem that Freud means to speak of the <span class="i">resolution</span> (German: <span class="i">Aufl&#246;sung</span>), rather than of the emergence (German: <span class="i">Auftauchen</span>), of the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span> as coinciding with their therapeutic dissipation. Now, for Freud, the &#8220;resolution of a <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptom</span>,&#8221; in turn, consists of using <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> to uncover the repressed pathogen that enters into the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yp0018611654130" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">compromise formation</span> that is held to constitute the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptom</span>. This much, then, is the statement of Freud's appeal to therapeutic success to vouch for the &#8220;correctness of our method&#8221; of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> as causally probative for etiologic research in psychopathology.</p>  
<p class="body">To articulate the argument adequately, however, we must still clarify Freud's original basis for claiming that (unsuccessful) <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span> is indeed the pathogen of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yp0013496709810" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">neurosis</span>. Only then will he have made his case for claiming that <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> is etiologically probative because it is uniquely capable of uncovering repressions. The pertinent argument is offered in Breuer and Freud's &#8220;Preliminary <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0000606445570" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">Communication</span>&#8221; (<span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0009" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1893/1955a</span>, pp. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.002.0001a#p0006">6-7</a>). There they wrote:</p>  
<p class="quote">For we found, to our great surprise at first, that <span class="i">each individual hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappeared when we had succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which it was provoked and in arousing its accompanying affect, and when the patient had described that event in the greatest possible detail and had put the affect into words.</span> Recollection without <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001a.yp0005740675060" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">affect</span> almost invariably produces no result.

(p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.002.0001a#p0006">6</a>)</p>  
<p class="body">Breuer and Freud then make an important comment on their construal of this therapeutic finding:</p>

<p class="body">And their avowed reason is that, in 1881, that is, in the &#8220;&#8217;presuggestion&#8217; era,&#8221; the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yp0020836498980" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">cathartic method</span> was used to remove separately distinct <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span>, &#8220;which sprang from separate causes&#8221; such that any one <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptom</span> disappeared only after the cathartic (&#8220;abre-active&#8221;) lifting of a particular <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span>. But Breuer and Freud do not tell us why the likelihood of placebo effect should be deemed to be lower when several <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span> are wiped out seriatim than in the case of getting rid of only one <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptom</span>. Thus, as I have pointed out elsewhere (Gr&#252;nbaum, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0048" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1993</span>, p. 238), to discredit the hypothesis of placebo effect, it would have been essential to have comparisons with treatment outcome from a suitable control group whose repressions are not lifted.

And, as they told us there explicitly, this therapeutic finding is their &#8220;evidence&#8221; for their cardinal etiologic hypothesis <span class="i">E.</span></p>  
<p class="body">But I maintain that this inductive argument is vitiated by what I like to call the &#8220;fallacy of crude hypothetico-deductive (H-D) pseudoconfirmation.&#8221; Thus, note that the remedial <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001a.yn0005417015680" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">action</span> of aspirin consumption for tension headaches does not lend H-D support to the outlandish etiologic hypothesis that a hematolytic aspirin <span class="i">deficiency</span> is a causal <span class="i">sine qua non</span> for having tension headaches, although such remedial <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001a.yn0005417015680" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">action</span> is validly deducible from that bizarre hypothesis. Twenty-five years ago, Wesley Salmon called <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001a.yn0019477127470" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">attention</span> to the fallacy of inductive causal inference from mere valid H-D deducibility by giving an example in which a deductively valid pseudoexplanation of a man's avoiding pregnancy can readily give rise to an H-D pseudoconfirmation of the addle-brained attribution of his nonpregnancy to his consumption of birth control pills. Salmon (<span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0065" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1971</span>, p. 34) states the fatuous pseudoexplanation: &#8220;John Jones avoided becoming pregnant during the past year, for he had taken his wife's birth control pills regularly, and every man who regularly takes birth control pills avoids pregnancy.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="body">Plainly, this deducibility of John Jones&#8217; recent failure to become pregnant from the stated premises does not lend any credence at all to the zany hypothesis that this <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001a.yn0004427752900" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">absence</span> of pregnancy is <span class="i">causally attributable</span> to his consumption of birth control pills. Yet it is</p>  
<p class="pagebreak"><a name="p0271"></a>- 270 -</p>  
<p class="body_cont">even true that any men who consume such pills <span class="i">in fact</span> never do become pregnant. Patently, as Salmon notes, the fly in the ointment is that men just do not become pregnant, whether they take birth control pills or not.</p>  
<p class="body">His example shows that neither the empirical truth of the deductively inferred conclusion and of the pertinent initial condition concerning Jones, nor the deductive validity of the inference can provide bona fide confirmation of the causal hypothesis that male consumption of birth control pills prevents male pregnancy: That hypothesis would first have to meet other epistemic requirements, which it manifestly cannot do.</p>  
<p class="body">Crude H-D confirmationism is a paradise of spurious causal inferences, as illustrated by Breuer and Freud's unsound etiologic inference. Thus, psychoanalytic narratives are replete with the belief that a hypothesized etiologic scenario embedded in a psychoanalytic <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yn0000880314790" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">narrative</span> of an analysand's affliction is <span class="i">made credible</span> merely because the postulated etiology then permits the logical deduction or probabilistic inference of the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yp0013496709810" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">neurotic</span>  <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span> to be explained.</p>  
<p class="body">Yet some apologists offer a facile excuse for the fallacious H-D confirmation of a causal hypothesis. We are told that the hypothesis is warranted by an &#8220;inference to the best explanation&#8221; (Harman, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0053" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1965</span>, pp. 85-95). But in a careful new study, Salmon (<span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0066" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">2001</span>, p. 79) has argued that &#8220;the characterization of nondemonstrative inference as inference to the best explanation serves to muddy the waters&#8230;by fostering confusion&#8221; between two sorts of why-questions that Hempel had distinguished: <span class="i">Explanation</span> -seeking questions as to why something is the case, and <span class="i">confirmation</span> -seeking why-questions as to why a hypothesis is <span class="i">credible</span>. Thus, a hypothesis that is pseudoconfirmed by some data cannot be warranted qua <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yn0015659043440" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">being</span> &#8220;the only [explanatory] game in town.&#8221; Alas, &#8220;best explanation&#8221;&#8212;sanction was claimed for psychoanalytic etiologies to explain and treat the destructive <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yp0012983181060" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">behavior</span> of sociopaths <span class="i">to no avail</span> for years (cf. <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0014" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Cleckley, 1988</span>, esp. pp. 238-239 and 438-439).</p>  
<p class="body">I can now demonstrate the multiple failure of Freud's therapeutic argument for the etiologic probativeness of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> in psychopathology, no matter how revealing the associative contents may otherwise be in regard to the <a name="hit10"></a><span class="searchhit">patient's</span> psychological preoccupations and <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0021254895470" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">personality</span> dispositions.

<p class="body">First, Freud inferred that the therapeutic disappearance of the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yp0013496709810" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">neurotic</span>  <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0011868560200" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">symptoms</span> is <span class="i">causally attributable</span> to the cathartic lifting of repressions <span class="i">by means of the method of free association</span>. Relying on this key therapeutic hypothesis, he then drew two further major theoretical inferences: (1) The seeming removal of the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yp0013496709810" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">neurosis</span> by means of cathartically <span class="i">lifting</span> repressions is good inductive evidence for postulating that repressions accompanied by affective <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0013291805380" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">suppression</span> are themselves <span class="i">causally necessary</span> for the very <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001e.yp0017512081750" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">existence</span> of a <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yp0013496709810" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">neurosis</span> (Breuer &amp; Freud <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0009" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1893/1955a</span>, pp. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.002.0001a#p0006">6-7</a>); and (2) granted that such repressions are thus the essential causes of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001n.yp0013496709810" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">neurosis</span>, <span class="i">and</span> that the method of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> is uniquely capable of uncovering these repressions, this method is uniquely competent <span class="i">to identify the causes</span> or pathogens of the neuroses. (Having convinced himself of the causal probative-ness of the method of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> on therapeutic grounds in the case of those neuroses he believed to be successfully treatable, Freud also felt justified in deeming the method reliable as a means of unearthing the etiologies of those other neuroses&#8212;the so-called narcissistic ones, such as <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0017412347390" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">paranoia</span>&#8212;that he considered psychoanalytically <span class="i">untreatable</span>.)</p>  
<p class="body">But the argument fails for the following several reasons. In the first place, the durable therapeutic success on which it was predicated did not materialize <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0006" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">(Borch-Jacobsen, 1996)</span>, as Freud was driven to admit both early and very late in his career (<span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0031" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1924/1959</span>, p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.020.0001a#p0027">27</a>; <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0038" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1937/1964a</span>, pp. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=se.023.0209a#p0216">216-253</a>).

<p class="body">Now let us consider Freud's argument for his cardinal thesis that <span class="i">sexual</span> repressions in particular are the pathogens of all neuroses, an argument he deemed &#8220;decisive.&#8221; Drawing on my earlier writings (Gr&#252;nbaum, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0047" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1990</span>, pp. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=apa.038.0559a#p0565">565-567</a>; <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0048" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1993</span>, pp. 152-158), we shall now find that this argument is without merit.</p>  
<p class="body">According to Freud's theory of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0017539537960" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">transference</span>, the patient <span class="i">transfers</span> onto his or her psychoanalyst, feelings and thoughts that originally pertained to important figures in his or her earlier life. In this important sense, the fantasies woven around the psychoanalyst by the analysand, and quite generally the latter's conduct toward his or her doctor, are hypothesized to be <span class="i">thematically recapitulatory</span> of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0011849316410" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">childhood</span> episodes.

Therefore, when the analyst interprets these supposed reenactments, the ensuing interpretations are called &#8220;<span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0017539537960" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">transference</span> interpretations.&#8221; But since the analyst typically has no independent epistemic access to the adult <a name="hit14"></a><span class="searchhit">patient's</span> <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0011849316410" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">childhood</span> episodes, they have to be inferred retrodictively in the first place from their supposed thematic recapitulation in the analytic treatment sessions.</p>  
<p class="body">Freud and his followers have traditionally drawn the following highly questionable causal inference: Precisely in virtue of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001b.yn0015659043440" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">being</span> thematically recapitulated in the patient-doctor interaction, the hypothesized earlier scenario in the <a name="hit15"></a><span class="searchhit">patient's</span> life can cogently be held to have originally been a <span class="i">pathogenic</span> factor in the <a name="hit16"></a><span class="searchhit">patient's</span> affliction. For example, in his case <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yn0016059068310" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">history</span> of the &#8220;Rat-Man,&#8221; <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0023" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Freud (1909/1955)</span> infers that a certain emotional <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0004220765300" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">conflict</span> had originally been the precipitating <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0004867612400" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">cause</span> of the <a name="hit17"></a><span class="searchhit">patient's</span> inability to work, merely because this <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0004220765300" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">conflict</span> had been thematically reenacted in a <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yn0010700504210" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">fantasy</span> the &#8220;Rat-Man&#8221; had woven around Freud during treatment.</p>  
<p class="body">Thus, in the context of Freud's <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0017539537960" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">transference</span> interpretations, the thematic reenactment is claimed to show that the early scenario had originally been <span class="i">pathogenic</span>.

In fact, some philosophers of science, such as Michael Friedman, have hailed explanatory unification as one of the great achievements and desiderata of the scientific enterprise.

Most recently, the noted clinical psychologist and philosopher of psychology <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0016" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Morris Eagle (1993)</span> has given a comprehensive and insightful answer to this question on which we can draw.</p>  
<p class="body"><span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0016" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Eagle (1993)</span> begins with a caveat:</p>  
<p class="quote">It is not at all clear that there is a uniform body of thought analogous to the main corpus of Freudian theory that can be called contemporary psychoanalytic theory. In the last 40 or 50 years there have been three major theoretical developments in <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span>: <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001e.yn0004333631400" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">ego psychology</span>, <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001o.yn0010361003460" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">object relations</span> theory, and self-psychology. If contemporary psychoanalytic theory is anything, it is one of these three or some combination, integrative or otherwise, of the three. (pp. 374)</p>  
<p class="body">Eagle makes no mention of Lacan's version of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span>, presumably because he does not take it seriously, as Lacanians have avowedly forsaken the need to validate their doctrines by familiar canons of evidence, not to mention Lacan's deliberate, irresponsible obscurity and notorious cruelty to <a name="hit31"></a><span class="searchhit">patients</span> <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0043" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">(Green, 1995/1996)</span>.</p>  
<p class="body">Previously, we had occasion to note that <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yp0017280982460" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">Heinz Hartmann</span>'s <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001e.yn0004333631400" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">ego psychology</span> departed from Freud's instinctual anchorage of the cognitive functions. But, more important, both <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001k.yp0014428612670" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">Heinz Kohut</span>'s <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0004708039940" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">self psychology</span> and the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001o.yn0010361003460" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">object relations</span> theory of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001k.yn0020938490480" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">Otto Kernberg</span> and the British school more fundamentally reject Freud's compromise model of psychopathology. Indeed, <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001s.yp0004708039940" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">self psychology</span> has repudiated virtually every one of Freud's major tenets (Eagle, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0016" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1993</span>, p. 388). Thus, Kohut supplants Freud's <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0004220765300" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">conflict</span> model of psychopathology, which is based on the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001r.yn0007443847010" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">repression</span> of internal sexual and aggressive wishes, by a psychology of self-defects and faulty function caused by hypothesized <span class="i">environmental events</span> going back to the first two years of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001i.yp0000087690250" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">infancy</span>. Relatedly, <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0056" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Kohut (1984)</span> denies, contra Freud, that <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001i.yn0000314554990" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">insight</span> is curative, designating instead the analyst's empathic understanding as the operative therapeutic agent. Again, the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001o.yn0010361003460" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">object relations</span> theorists deny that the etiology of pathology lies in Freudian (Oedipal) conflicts and traumas involving sex and <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001a.yn0013535936150" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">aggression</span>, claiming instead that the quality of maternal caring is the crucial factor.</p>  
<p class="body">Yet these two post-Freudian schools not only diverge from Freud but also disagree with each other. Thus, the orthodox psychoanalysts Arlow and Brenner speak ruefully of &#8220;the differences among all these theories, so apparent to every observer&#8221; (<span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0002" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1988</span>, p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=paq.057.0001a#p0009">9</a>), hoping wistfully that refined honing of the psychoanalytic method of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span> will yield a common body of data, which &#8220;would in the end resolve the <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001c.yn0004220765300" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">conflict</span> among competing theories&#8221; (p. <a class="pgx" href="document.php?id=paq.057.0001a#p0011">11</a>). But their hope is utopian, if only because of the severe probative limitations of the method of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001f.yp0004673890530" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">free association</span>. How, for example, could a method of putting adults on the couch possibly have the epistemological resources to resolve the three-way clash among the Freudian and two post-Freudian schools in regard to the <span class="i">infantile</span> etiologies of psychopathology? <span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0054" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">Otto Kernberg's (1993)</span> account of the &#8220;Convergences and Divergences in Contemporary Psychoanalytic <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001t.yn0012766571790" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">Technique</span>&#8221; does not solve that problem. And, as other psychoanalysts themselves have documented, there are several clear signs that the future of the sundry clinical and theoretical enterprises that label themselves &#8220;psychoanalytic&#8221; is now increasingly in jeopardy. For example, the pool of <a name="hit32"></a><span class="searchhit">patients</span> seeking (full-term) psychoanalytic treatment in the United States has been steadily shrinking, and academic psychoanalysts are becoming an endangered species in</p>

No wonder that the subtitle of the 1988 book <span class="i">Psychoanalysis</span> by the well-known analyst Marshall Edelson is <span class="i">A Theory in Crisis</span>.</p>  
<p class="body">But what about the evidential merits of the two post-Freudian developments that are usually designated as &#8220;<span class="i">contemporary</span>  <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001p.yn0004507089640" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">psychoanalysis</span>&#8221;? Do they constitute an <span class="i">advance</span> over Freud? The answer turns largely, though not entirely, on whether there is <span class="i">better evidential support</span> for them than for Freud's classical edifice. But Eagle (<span class="peppopup bibtip" data-type="velcro" data-element="b0016" data-maxwidth="300" data-direction="southeast">1993</span>, p. 404) argues that the verdict is clearly negative: &#8220;The different variants of so-called contemporary psychoanalytic theory&#8230;are on no firmer epistemological ground than the central formulations and claims of Freudian theory&#8230;. There is no evidence that contemporary psychoanalytic theories have remedied the epistemological and methodological difficulties that are associated with Freudian theory.&#8221;</p>

<p class="body">Since the psychoanalytic enterprise is now in its second century, it behooved us to take thorough stock of its past performance qua theory of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001h.yp0007772036560" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">human nature</span> and therapy, as well as to assess its prospects.
