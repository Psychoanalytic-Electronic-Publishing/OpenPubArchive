<body><p>There have been six meetings of the Society since the last report.</p>
<p>The Meeting held on January 4, 1922 was devoted to a general discussion on various points brought forward by members.</p>
<p>At the Meeting on January 18, Mr. Duggan (a visitor) read a paper on 'Psycho-Analytical Principles in Education'.</p>
<p>Abstract:  In recent years the aims and methods of education have been considerably changed.  Psycho-analysis is of value in helping us to attain our aims.  It affects the educator in two ways, by revealing his own complexes and by giving insight into the child's mind.  At present we need chiefly to avoid the mistakes of the old educators in the problems which faced them.  These are often connected with the sexual life, notably masturbation and homosexuality.  Whatever may be the best solution the old methods are to be deprecated.  Experiments in new methods appear to be desirable.</p>
<p>A discussion took place on the various points raised in the paper.</p>
<p>At the Meeting on February 1, Miss May Smith (a visitor) read a paper on 'Repression in Industry'.</p>
<p>Abstract:  The conditions of modern factory life involve a very considerable repression on the part of individuals, for against a background of compulsion and monotony the self-assertive instinct in particular has little chance for expression.  To some in whom this instinct is weak the situation is not difficult, but to others the difficulty of adjustment is great, and the resultant differences in conduct are great.  Several types seem to stand out clearly:</p>

</li>

</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0264" prefixused="">263</n></pb>
<p><list type="NONE"><li><p name="ListLabel1">2.<tab/>The type that is outwardly submissive, but compensates in phantasy life.</p>
</li>
<li><p name="ListLabel1">3.<tab/>The type that reacts in exaggerated form outside the works, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p name="ListLabel1">4.<tab/>The type that reconciles anxiously the two instincts.</p>
</li>
</list>
</p>
<p>Various points arising out of the paper were then discussed.</p>
<p>At the Meeting on February 16, Rev. P. Youlden Johnson (a visitor) read a paper entitled 'Technical Terms for the Various Dynamic States of the Mind'.</p>
<p>Abstract:  The chaotic state of psychological terminology and consequent confusion.  The danger of static rather than dynamic interpretation of present terms.  The failure of the conscious to find original terms.  The marks of the Freudian teaching, i.e. work of the unconscious traced, even in this failure.  The task then given as an experiment to the unfettered unconscious and the result analysed by the Freudian method.  The terms found fulfilled all four previously determined conditions, confirmed Freud's teaching regarding infantile and childhood's impressions and choice of material, and were therefore Freudian in nature and typically Freudian in respect to the dynamic states of the mind as classified by Ernest Jones.  A discussion followed.</p>
<p>At the Meeting on March 1, Dr. W. Inman (a visitor) read a paper on 'Some Psychical Symptoms in Ophthalmic Practice'.</p>
<p>Abstract:  The paper dealt with the generally accepted opinion amongst the public and the medical profession that the most common cause of headache was eye-strain, and the view was expressed that whilst frontal aching, due to over-action of the frontalis and corrugator supercilii muscles, was frequently associated with an appreciable error of refraction, there was grave reason for doubting if pain elsewhere was ever caused by eyestrain.  It had been found that many other neurotic symptoms were present in these cases, and that when one was removed the patients usually took refuge in another.</p>
<p>In accordance with the view that the eye had a phallic significance several symptoms associated with the appendages of the eyes were brought forward, including fibrillary twitching of the orbicularis muscle ('live blood'), watering of the eyes without obvious obstruction of the tear passage or reflex irritation, inflammation of the conjunctiva at times of emotional stress (comparable with the conjunctivitis neurotica described by Abraham), atropine irritation of the lids, </p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0265" prefixused="">264</n></pb>
<p2>and denudation of the brows and eyelashes.  Cases illustrating these conditions were described.</p2><p>Inequality of the pupils and partial ptosis following psychical disturbance were referred to.</p>
<p>A relation between concomitant squint or heterophoria, left-handedness and stammering had been found in a series of over five hundred cases, and the opinion was expressed that whereas the left-handers almost invariably proved to be rebels against parental authority, the squinting and stammering were indications that an element of fear was present in the attitude of the children towards one or both parents.</p>
<p>A discussion followed.</p>
<p>At the Meeting on March 15, the Interim Report of the Propaganda Sub-committee was discussed.  The points brought forward specially concerned methods for increasing the circulation of the <i>International Journal of Psycho-Analysis</i>, and getting the status and activities of the Society more widely recognised.  The question of the organisation of a course of lectures was considered and the sub-committee was asked to make a further report with respect to details, such as lecturers, syllabus of lectures, etc.</p>
