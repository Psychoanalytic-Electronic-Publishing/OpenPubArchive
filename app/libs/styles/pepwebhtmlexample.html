I am therefore studying the substance of <span class="i">illusion</span>, that which is allowed to the infant, and which in adult life is inherent in art and religion, and yet becomes the hallmark of madness when an adult puts too powerful a claim on the credulity of others, forcing them to acknowledge a sharing of <span class="peppopup glosstip" data-width="800" data-type="sticky" data-docid="zbk.069.0001i.yn0004499838210" data-draggable="true" data-direction="southwest">illusion</span> that is not their own. We can share a respect for <span class="i">illusory experience</span>, and if we wish we may collect together and form a group on the basis of the similarity of our illusory experiences.
