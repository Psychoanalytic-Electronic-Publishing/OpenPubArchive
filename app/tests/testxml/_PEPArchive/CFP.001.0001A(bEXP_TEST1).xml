<abs><p>Couple and family psychoanalysis are disciplines in search of definition. This paper offers a definition of couple psychoanalysis and considers its relationship to couple therapy. It reflects on Oedipal dimensions of the couple therapist's role, and explores contextual aspects of four clinical challenges intrinsic to that role: (1) looking in and looking out; (2) relating to sex and gender; (3) engaging with difference; (4) conserving and changing. The paper concludes with the assertion that three is a community, not a crowd, and that couple therapy, like couple psychoanalysis, is about building communities.</p></abs>

        <p>‘Despite its long history of struggles against marginalisation and professional
            disempowerment, couple therapy at the millennium has emerged as one of the most vibrant
            forces in the entire domain of family therapy and of psychotherapy in general … no other
            collective methods of psychosocial intervention have demonstrated a superior capacity to
            effect clinically meaningful change in as many spheres of human experience as the couple
            therapies.’ (Gurman &amp; Fraenkel, <bx r="B019">2002</bx>, p. <pgx r="B019">199</pgx>)</p>
