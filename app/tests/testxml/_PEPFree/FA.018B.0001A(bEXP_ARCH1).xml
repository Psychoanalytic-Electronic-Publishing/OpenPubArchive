        <p>Tension between the ideal of analytic neutrality — although conceived and applied in
            various ways — and the putative danger of political neutrality is intrinsic to
            psychoanalytic investigations of culture and society. It presents itself with urgency in
            times of social conflict, especially when such conflict is characterized by or framed in
            terms of victimization, but it has not been a subject of rigorous debate. That the
            tension between analytic and political neutrality has not been widely examined might
            mean that when analysts engage in scholarly work outside of clinical settings (e.g.,
            writing books or papers), we adopt a different set of norms to guide our behavior, norms
            that do not include whatever attitude of neutrality we may observe in the consulting
            room. But it might also mean that this tension is a site of resistance, that we are
            unwilling to look closely at a difficult aspect of our work because we expect it to
            yield uncomfortable experience. Of course, this resistance may be largely unconscious,
            leading us to miss or mistake the meanings and consequences of our positions.</p>
