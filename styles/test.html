These discrepancies and disjunctions had led him towards a consideration of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p class="para" id="d0e67">In 1940 in the Outline, Freud had said that the ego (or the id) was the great reservoir of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001l.YP0006482592450" data-grpname="Libido">libido</span>&#8212;something like an amoeba putting out and withdrawing libidinal pseudopodia.  But by this date Freud's ego was no longer the
            'poor thing' of his earlier formulation.  It was the ego, big and strong, the commanding, autonomous <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001m.YP0008975205160" data-grpname="MASTER">master</span> in its own house.  We could have asked ourselves how can this ego also be the amoeba?  Hartmann (1949) clarified the problem for us.  <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">The self</span> is the great reservoir of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001l.YP0006482592450" data-grpname="Libido">libido</span>, of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001n.YP0004638686200" data-grpname="Narcissism">narcissism</span>.  The ego remains the great system of functions and of central control.  Kohut <span class="bx biblioref" data-xref="B0007" id="d0e96">(1966)</span>, <span class="bx biblioref" data-xref="B0008" id="d0e99">(1968)</span> has worked out for us the developmental paths of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p class="para" id="d0e106">We can now say that the ego is a quite anonymous system of functions, the relatively fixed boundaries of which are limited
            by the tools man has available to his hand.

In a general way we might say that ego and self are opposed, with differing, although related, developmental histories.
             Following Kohut <span class="bx biblioref" data-xref="B0007" id="d0e188">(1966)</span> we could summarize one of the life tasks of the ego as a long struggle for increasing dominance over the narcissistic energies

         </p>
         
         <p class="para" id="d0e195">There are many references to <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span> in the psychoanalytic literature today.  We might ask ourselves to what extent we have now to regard <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span> as a special <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001a.YN0012579328430" data-grpname="Agency">agency</span> (as we regard ego, <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001s.YN0003128406840" data-grpname="SUPEREGO; Super-Ego">superego</span> and id) and to what exten we are viewing just a passing fashion.  Clinical <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001m.YN0018787855710" data-grpname="Material">material</span> will eventually decide this question.  But, outside of Freud's reluctantly published personal 'indiscretions' (as he called
            them in the <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001d.YP0010931565630" data-grpname="DREAMS; DREAMING">dream</span> book) and outside of Kohut's <span class="bx biblioref" data-xref="B0008" id="d0e215">(1968)</span> paper, clear-cut clinical <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001m.YN0018787855710" data-grpname="Material">material</span> on <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span> is very hard to find in the literature.
         </p>
         
         <p class="para" id="d0e225">The speaker had chosen, therefore, for illustrative clinical <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001m.YN0018787855710" data-grpname="Material">material</span> on <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span>, the well-known record of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001b.YP0021265060230" data-grpname="BREUER, JOSEF; JOSEF BREUER">Josef Breuer</span>'s pioneering analysis of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001a.YP0008572255170" data-grpname="ANNA O">Anna O</span>.  There was for Breuer a <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001c.YN0004220765300" data-grpname="CONFLICT; INTRAPSYCHIC CONFLICT">conflict</span> between his own (narcissistically perceived) style of life and the new clinical facts which he himself had discovered.  In
            the end Breuer settled the <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001c.YN0004220765300" data-grpname="CONFLICT; INTRAPSYCHIC CONFLICT">conflict</span> by opting for the former and suppressing the latter.  As he wrote later in a letter <span class="bx biblioref" data-xref="B0001" id="d0e245">(Cranefield, 1958)</span>, Breuer 'found it impossible &#8230; to treat a case of that kind without bringing his (own) activities and mode of life completely
            to an end'.  'The case of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001a.YP0008572255170" data-grpname="ANNA O">Anna O</span>., ' Breuer continued, 'which was the germ cell of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001p.YN0004507089640" data-grpname="Psycho-Analysis; PSYCHOANALYSIS">psychoanalysis</span>, proves that a fairly severe case of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001h.YP0003548993690" data-grpname="Hysteria">hysteria</span> can develop, flourish and be resolved without having a sexual basis.'  We can see here, in Breuer's prevarication, a clinical
            example of a victory for the narcissistic (or grandiose) self over the ego and over real life.  We know how it came about
            that, faced with the same <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001c.YN0004220765300" data-grpname="CONFLICT; INTRAPSYCHIC CONFLICT">conflict</span>, Freud took a different direction and how, for Freud, the struggle ended in a victory for the ego and for real life over
            the illusory gratifications of the <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001g.YN0005805564140" data-grpname="GRANDIOSE SELF">grandiose self</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p class="para" id="d0e264">The lifelong struggle for dominance between ego and self may turn out to be, the speaker suggested, the main spring of what
            we call <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001r.YN0018966170770" data-grpname="Resistance">resistance</span>.  If we do conclude in the end that <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span> is indeed the seat of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001r.YN0018966170770" data-grpname="Resistance">resistance</span>, then it seems that we will have to regard <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span> as a special <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001a.YN0012579328430" data-grpname="Agency">agency</span>, operationally more or less equal with ego, <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001s.YN0003128406840" data-grpname="SUPEREGO; Super-Ego">superego</span> and id.  If so, then we will have to modify our technical stance in order to stand equidistant not only from ego, <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001s.YN0003128406840" data-grpname="SUPEREGO; Super-Ego">superego</span> and id, but also equidistant from the <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001g.YN0005805564140" data-grpname="GRANDIOSE SELF">grandiose self</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p class="para" id="d0e291">In following out this line of thought at least two questions arise.  The first question might be to ask why Freud never wrote
            out a theory of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span>.  There could be many factors; one of these, the speaker suggested, might be that Freud's understanding of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span> is embodied and embedded in his technical rules.  (The technical rules have in fact remained just rules, somewhat isolated
            and disconnected from the main body of theory.)
         </p>
         
         <p class="para" id="d0e300">Another question might be to ask what would be the price we will have to pay if we include <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span> in the special agencies of the psyche.  The price, the speaker suggested, may include something of the kind of personal struggle
            from which Freud himself successfully emerged.

            cohesiveness which is acquired early in life&#8212;is one of the preconditions for the ego's reliable ability to perform its functions.
             We might say that <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span> may serve as an organizer of ego activities.

            one from the other and be lacking in firmness of purpose and integrated cohesion.  If, finally, in the course of the analysis
            of a pathological self, the genetic roots of the disturbance are brought into the open, and if the specific <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001w.YP0005110024630" data-grpname="WORKING THROUGH">working-through</span> process leads to a firming of the <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001s.YN0021397840800" data-grpname="STRUCTURE, PSYCHIC; PSYCHIC STRUCTURE">structure</span> of <span class="impx" data-type="TERM2" data-rx="ZBK.069.0001t.YP0002234623310" data-grpname="The Self">the self</span>, then it can be observed that, pari passu, the patient's ego functions will also improve.
