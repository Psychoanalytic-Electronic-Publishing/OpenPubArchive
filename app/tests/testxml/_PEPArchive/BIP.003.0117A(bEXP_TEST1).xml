<body><h1 c="t">Annual General Meeting</h1>
<p>The Annual General Meeting of the Members of the British Psycho-Analytical Society was held on October 13, 1921.</p>
<p>The following Officers of the Society were re-elected for the ensuing year:</p>
<p name="ListNone1"><i>President:</i>  Dr. Ernest Jones.</p>
<p name="ListNone1"><i>Hon. Treasurer:</i>  Dr. W. H. B. Stoddart.</p>
<p name="ListNone1"><i>Hon. Secretary:</i>  Dr. Douglas Bryan.</p>
<p>Dr. Stoddart proposed and Dr. Read seconded the following alteration in Rule 5 ('The management of the Society shall be in the hands of a Council consisting of the President, Hon. Treasurer, Hon. Secretary and not fewer than two other Members who shall be elected annually in October'.)  After the words 'Hon. Secretary' read 'and one other Member' etc. instead of 'and not fewer than two other Members' etc.</p>
<p>Dr. Cole proposed and Miss Low seconded the following amendment 'That the Council should be increased by having more than two Members in addition to the President, Hon. Treasurer, and Hon. Secretary'.</p>
<p>After some discussion the amendment was put to the Meeting and was lost.  The original proposal was then voted upon and carried.</p>
<p>Mr. J. C. Flügel was re-elected a Member of the Council.</p>
<p>The following Associate Members nominated by the Council were re-elected:  Dr. Mitchell, Dr. Hart, Dr. Rivers, Prof. Percy Nunn, Dr. Brend, Mrs. Porter, Dr. Davison, Dr. Jago, Major Ryan, Dr. Wright, Dr. Bowen, Dr. Culpin, Dr. Thacker, Dr. Rickman, Dr. Chuckerbutty, Dr. Smith, Major McWatters, Rev.

<pb><n nextpgnum="P0118" prefixused="">117</n></pb>
<p>The following were elected Associate Members.  Dr. C. Bose, Mrs. Brierley, Dr. Herford, Miss Ella Sharp.</p>
<p>The following alteration of Rule 8 ('All elections shall be made by ballot.  Absent Members may communicate their vote to the Hon. Secretary.  One adverse vote in six shall exclude'.) was proposed by the Council.  After 'Hon. Secretary.' read 'One adverse vote in four shall exclude' instead of 'One adverse vote in six shall exclude'.  This was carried.</p>
<p>Dr. Estelle Cole who had sent in the following resolution 'That there should be a woman representative on the Council of the Society' withdrew it after the discussion and voting upon Dr. Stoddart's alteration of Rule 5.</p>
<p>The two following resolutions (proposed by Dr. Cole):</p>
<p>1.  That there should be some rule regarding the continual non-attendance of Associate Members at the Meetings.</p>
<p>2.  That there should be some rule regarding the attendance of Members and Associate Members outside the London area. were withdrawn after some discussion.</p>
<p>Miss Low moved that 'There should be a fixed date for the Annual General Meeting'.  After a short discussion such a fixed date was considered impracticable.</p>
<p>Miss Low moved the following resolution, 'That nominations for Officers and Council be sent to the Secretary not later than one month before the Annual General Meeting'.  After some discussion it was decided to add the following rule to the present rules, 'That nominations for Officers and Council, proposed alteration of rules, resolutions, etc. be sent in to the Hon. Secretary not later than one month before the date of the Annual General Meeting.'</p>
<p>It was decided to hold fortnightly meetings of Members and Associate Members.</p>
<p>The Hon. Treasurer's report of the finances of the Society showed that the receipts amounted to £87 18s. 9d., which included a balance from the previous year of £7 os. od.  The expenses were subscription to the JOURNAL £38 os. od., subscription to the Association £15 12s. 6d., and Secretarial expenses £9 3s. 7d., leaving a balance in hand of £25 2s. 5d.</p>
<p>The Hon. Secretary reported that the Society now consisted of thirteen Members and twenty-seven Associate Members.  One Member, Mr. Hiller, had resigned, having joined the Vienna</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0119" prefixused="">118</n></pb>
<p2>Society.  Fourteen new Associate Members had been elected during the year.  Dr. Ferenczi and Dr. Otto Rank had been elected as Honorary Members.  During the year there had been ten Meetings of Members and Associate Members, seven Meetings of Members, and seven Council Meetings.</p2><h1 c="t">Quarterly Report</h1>
<p>There have been five Meetings of Members and Associate Members since the last report.  The attendance at the Meetings has been very good, and some interesting discussions have taken place.</p>
<p>At a Meeting held on October 19, 1921 Dr. Bryan read a paper on 'The Psycho-Analyst'.  He drew attention to certain characteristics usually found in medical men that would have to be renounced in those who contemplated taking up treatment by psycho-analysis.  He discussed the various motives that led to the taking up of psycho-analysis, and then dealt more specifically with the qualifications necessary for the work.  He made a few remarks with special reference to lay analysts, and concluded by referring to the future training of psycho-analysts.</p>
<p>In the discussion that followed Dr. Jones amplified some of the points mentioned in the paper and criticised others.  Other Members expressed their views.</p>
<p>On November 2, Dr. Stoddart read a paper on 'The Emotional Factor in Enteroptosis'.  He pointed out that in anxiety states there is an outpouring of adrenalin which causes gastric dilatation by stimulating the sympathetic.  This allows the transverse and ascending colon to fall, the latter dragging the right kidney from its fatty bed.  Both stomach and colon sometimes reach the true pelvis.  The question arises whether such extreme cases of enteroptosis could be cured by psycho-analysis alone.</p>
<p>An interesting discussion followed.</p>
<p>On November 16, Dr. Ernest Jones made some remarks on 'Introjection and Projection'.  After discussing the general topic of the two processes he quoted a question raised by Prof. Freud of whether many instances of apparent projection in paranoia were not really cases where the subject correctly divined the unconscious of the other person.  A discussion followed.</p>

<p>On December 7, Dr. Culpin read notes on a case of severe and long-standing asthma related to remorse from adolescent masturbation and to fears of child-birth; any situation suggesting these emotions produced an attack.  The trouble almost completely disappeared after a superficial analysis.</p>
<p>In another case attacks of respiratory disturbance apparently dangerous to life and associated with complicated anxiety states were related to masturbation and conscious masochistic phantasies.  Deeper analysis was followed by cessation of the physical symptoms and great relief of the anxiety.</p>
<p>Many points arising out of these cases were discussed by the members.</p>
<p>On December 21, Dr. Estelle Maude Cole read notes on 'The Abreaction of Fear in relation to Circumcision'.  The notes referred to the case of a patient (medical man) who was undergoing psycho-analytic treatment, and who during this treatment had an endocrine investigation carried out on himself by another medical man, an anæsthetic being administered for this purpose.  On describing this to the analyst the patient developed violent agitation of the limbs and body, his skin became cold and clammy, the pulse fell to fifty-two, and he cried piteously in extreme distress.  His condition appearing serious the analyst took his pulse; this act had the effect of controlling him.  On his becoming quiet the memory immediately emerged of his terror when he was circumcised at six years of age.  This memory Dr. Cole pointed out was evidently related to a strong and prior castration complex.  The interest in this case was the extremely severe abreaction.</p>
<p>Dr. Jago read a paper on 'Tuberculosis and Neurosis'.  He pointed out that many cases are to be found with combined symptoms of anxiety neurosis and neurasthenia, but in which a direct sexual cause cannot be discovered.  The same symptoms are present in the 'closed' type of tuberculosis.  The symptoms can often be traced to their appearance after a period of physical stress or a debilitating illness, conditions which cause auto-intoxication in tuberculosis.  Treatment on similar lines to tuberculosis causes improvement in the symptoms.</p>
<p>Tubercle toxin has an excitant effect on the sexual centres, thereby leading to a physical (inner) increase of the libido.  Social reasons may prevent the patient from gratifying the libido, and thus conflict results.  The exhaustion following continued auto-intoxication</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0121" prefixused="">120</n></pb>
<p2>leads to neurasthenic symptoms.  He suggested that tuberculous auto-intoxication may give rise to an anxiety neurosis or a neurasthenia, and that it may precipitate a psycho-neurosis in a person psychically predisposed.</p2><p>Members joined in a discussion of this paper.</p>
