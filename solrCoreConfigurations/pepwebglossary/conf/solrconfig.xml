 It uses defaults or does not define most of production-level settings
 such as various caches or auto-commit policies.

   get all bug fixes and improvements. It is highly recommended
   that you fully re-index after changing this setting as it can
   affect both how text is indexed and queried.

    <!-- Enables a transaction log, used for real-time get, durability, and

         is recommended (see below).
         "dir" - the target directory for transaction logs, defaults to the
                solr data directory.
         "numVersionBuckets" - sets the number of buckets used to keep
                track of max version values when checking for re-ordered
                updates; increase this value to reduce the cost of
                synchronizing access to version buckets during high-volume
                indexing, this requires 8 bytes (long) * numVersionBuckets
                of heap space per Solr core.

  <!-- AutoCommit

       Perform a hard commit automatically under certain conditions.
       Instead of enabling autoCommit, consider using "commitWithin"
       when adding documents.

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/UpdateXmlMessages

       maxDocs - Maximum number of documents to add since the last
                 commit before automatically triggering a new commit.

       maxTime - Maximum amount of time in ms that is allowed to pass
                 since a document was added before automatically
                 triggering a new commit.
       openSearcher - if false, the commit causes recent index changes
         to be flushed to stable storage, but does not cause a new
         searcher to be opened to make those changes visible.

       If the updateLog is enabled, then it's highly recommended to
       have some sort of hard autoCommit to limit the log size.
