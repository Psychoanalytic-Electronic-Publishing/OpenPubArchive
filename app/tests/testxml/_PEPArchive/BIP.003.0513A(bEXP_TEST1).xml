<body><p>Owing to the political state of Russia, it is more than usually difficult to collect facts or to record progress in psycho-analytical circles.  Russia has been split asunder by the revolution and the ensuing civil wars, and as there is no communication between the separate parts, it has been impossible to collect and publish accounts</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0514" prefixused="">513</n></pb>
<p2>either of proceedings of meetings or of papers read and discussed.  Scientific journals have entirely ceased to appear during the last three years:  the only journal concerning itself with Freudian conceptions— <i>Psychotherapia</i> —stopped publication in 1917, owing to financial difficulties.</p2><p>Such being the conditions, it is only possible to speak or write from personal knowledge of what has transpired in the narrowest scientific circles, so that although psycho-analytical thought may be making headway in this or that part of Russia, no news has filtered through.</p>
<p>The followings reports are concerned solely with work done in Petrograd and Moscow.  Dr. Sara Neiditsch (Berlin) is responsible for the Petrograd report, and Dr. Ossipow (Prag) for the Moscow details, to which Dr. Passenheim, who has but lately returned from that city, has contributed information which is incorporated in this general report.</p>
<p>Representative men of science show but little interest for the theory of psycho-analysis and none whatever for the practice thereof.  At their meetings mention is occasionally made of the Freudian dynamic conception of mental processes.  Freud's sexual theory, <i>a priori, </i> meets with little sympathy.  In spite of this aloofness the position is not unfavourable, as the following facts will show.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1919 the Mosga Institute was opened in Petrograd under the presidency of Professor Bechterew.  This Institute was founded for the study of brain pathology.  The clinical department was under the supervision of Dr. Tatiana Rosenthal, and the treatment of neurotic patients is chiefly on psycho-analytical lines, with Dr. Rosenthal as the official psycho-analyst.</p>
<p>In the course of the winter session 1919-20, Dr. T. Rosenthal gave a course of lectures on psycho-analysis in the Mosga Institute.</p>
<p>Another Institute was opened in the autumn months of 1920 by the School Care Committee for Backward Children, and here also the treatment of psycho-neurotic children is based on psycho-analysis.  Professor Bechterew is the director of this clinic, and Dr. Rosenthal was the head physician.  In an address on 'Mental disturbances of children', Professor Griboyedow, the chief official of the Care Committee department, went into the question of psycho-analysis, and although he criticised the sexual theories, he emphasized their great value.</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0515" prefixused="">514</n></pb>
<p>At the first National Congress of Russian Care Committees for Backward Children, held in August 1920 in Moscow, Dr. Rosenthal read a paper on 'The value of Freudian conceptions in the education of children'.  This important Congress was attended by teachers and members of the medical profession, and the discussions following on her paper were stimulating and favourable.  A resolution was proposed by Dr. Rosenthal that all doctors and teachers of young children should be trained in psycho-analysis, but for some unknown reason this was not put to the vote.</p>
<p>In February, 1920, a journal entitled 'Questions of Individual Psychology' appeared with an article by Dr. Rosenthal on 'The suffering and the work of Dostojewski', a psychological inquiry.  In this article she tried to show the connection between his morbid peculiarities and his creative powers.  From a psycho-analytical point of view the article is full of interest.  In the theoretical part of the paper, complete acceptance and application of the Freudian teachings are wanting, and in consequence we have confusion of thought; for together with deprecatory remarks on Freud's psychosexual monism as the driving force of artistic work, we find Dr. Rosenthal full of appreciation of Freud's service to the deeper understanding of the individual artist's work.  She says:  'Putting the psycho-sexual monism on one side, the psycho-analytical conceptions of Freud maintain that the root principle of creative expression lies in the immanent unconscious driving and purposive processes.  Artistic creation depends wholly on the desires of the artist.  Dissatisfaction with reality, the wish to be free from all privations result in the artist turning away from reality and transferring his interests to the realisation of his phantasy-life.  The artist creates above all to satisfy himself.  Subjective feelings of freedom that creative power brings along with it, the opportunity of projecting parts of his own ego into his own productions, offer the artist the possibility of relieving his mental strain.  He is thus delivered from his sorrows and enjoys great happiness.'  The writer draws attention to the fact that this point of view more especially lays stress on the subjective emotional basis of creative art, and is analogous to the phantasies and creations of mental derangement and of neurotics; she emphasizes, however, the fact that the difference between the creations of a neurotic and an artist are infinitely greater and more important than the similarity of the</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0516" prefixused="">515</n></pb>
<p2>psycho-genesis, and that the theories of Freud do not solve the root problem of creative genius.</p2><p>The analytical part deals with those works of Dostojewski which lie between his first powerful and successful work 'Poor Folk' and his arrest.  A period of loneliness, poverty and hardship stunted his mental powers.  His nearest friends failed to understand his condition, and his outpourings were accepted with great hesitation.  In his works, Dostojewski turns from reality, regressing to a world of phantasy, and he grows more and more egocentric.  'The Second Self', 'Netotschka Neswanowa' and 'The Landlady' fall within this period.  Basing her remarks on a careful study of his biography and autobiography, Professor Rosenthal shows that Dostojewski in all these novels portrays his own mental state.  In 'The Second Self', he depicts a maniacal excitement with hallucinations.  In the person of Goliadkin the younger, the hallucinations of the 'second self' give the wish-fulfilment of those desires which the moral personality of Goliadkin abhors and represses.</p>
<p>'Netotschka Neswanowa' is a confession.  Here we have an amiable musician whose first production is his masterpiece and who retreats more and more into himself till he ends in madness.  A friend of this musician is made to say:  'It was a bitter struggle between the morbidly strained will and the complete inner powerlessness for the production of purposive work.  For whilst his sick phantasies forged the most impossible plans for the future, he did not notice that he had lost the key to all art, the fundamental mechanism.'  To this Professor Rosenthal says 'We need but substitute amiable writer for "amiable musician" to understand the fate of Dostojewski.  The similarity between the two is to be found in the smallest details; take this for instance:  "A friend once met the unhappy and degraded musician in the street, and the latter turned away as if he had not seen him".  According to Panajewa, the exact incident, even to time, happened to Dostojewski.'</p>
<p>In 'The Landlady', the Oedipus complex is portrayed exactly according to Freudian lines.  But the bearing and interpretation of the complex in relation to the whole output of the author is overlooked.</p>
<p>In the second part of the article the writer had intended to analyse those novels which take their place among the foremost in the whole of literature, but her death prevented this.  Dr. Tatiana Rosenthal was but 36 years old, the mother of a gifted, much-loved</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0517" prefixused="">516</n></pb>
<p2>child, competent and successful in her profession, but her end came tragically by her own hand.  She began her studies at the age of 17 in Zurich, when full of enthusiasm for social amelioration, and joined the social democratic party.  Her studies were interrupted several times by her zeal for the revolutionary agitation in Russia.  In 1906 she again returned to Zurich, weary and dispirited, wavering between medicine and law.  She believed at that date that the latter profession would help more definitely in her social work.  Quite by accident she came across Freud's 'Interpretation of Dreams' and was full of enthusiasm, foreseeing a new horizon for psychology along the path of self-revelation to which Freud points the way.  She exclaimed 'What a harmony we might have with the combination of Freud and Marx'.  Her determination to take up medicine and especially psychiatry was in a great measure owing to this chance acquaintance with Freud.  In 1911, after finishing her medical examinations, she returned to Petrograd as a trained and proficient psycho-analyst, fully prepared to spread the teachings of Freud.  She used every opportunity at scientific meetings, apart from her own special lectures, to press the question of psycho-analysis.  Opposition to the sexual theories she met by putting the doctrines of repression and sublimation in the foreground and pointing out that the horrifying impression produced by the sexual theory should be equated by Freud's teachings of the possibility of sublimation.</p2><p>Any headway that psycho-analytic thought may have made in Petrograd during recent years is owing in a great measure to the steady work of Dr. Tatiana Rosenthal.  Practical work on broad lines became possible during the last few years of her life.  As head physician at the Institute for the study of Brain Pathology, opened in 1919, she gave the psycho-neurotic patients psycho-analytic treatment.  It was here also that she lectured on the subject.  Her intense wish to found and direct an Institute for the treatment of psycho-neurotic children was realised in the autumn of 1920, and she here applied the re-educational bearings of the science of psycho-analysis.  She put all her strength into the development of this Institute, assisted by a few young fellow-workers whom she had specially trained.  Unfortunately no up-to-date report has been received of the undertaking.</p>
<p>The literary psycho-analytical work of Dr. Tatiana Rosenthal is best appreciated in her essay '"The Dangerous Age" in the light of</p>

</ftn></ftr><n nextpgnum="P0518" prefixused="">517</n></pb>
<p2>Psycho-Analysis'.<ftnx r="F001" type="PG">1</ftnx>  In 1920 the first part of her afore-mentioned article on Dostojewsky appeared under the title of 'The sorrows and labours of Dostojewski'.  Of her other literary efforts, we may mention 'The Anxiety Affects of War Neurotics' and 'Adler's Individual Psychology'.  She read papers and spoke on Adler's theories at scientific meetings.</p2><p>To turn now to Moscow.  Professor Serbsky was director of the University clinic for psychiatry and did good service to his country in both the practical and theoretical side of this work before he died in 1917.  The following account will explain his position to psycho-analysis.  Dr. Ossipow was physician in charge of this clinic, and on presenting his first report based on Freudian teachings to a committee of his clinical co-workers, he received an appreciative hearing.  This report was based on the first findings of Freud, and did not take into consideration the newer aspects as presented in 'Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex.'  Professor Serbsky was satisfied that the predominating factor in the aetiology of a neurosis was to be found in sexual disturbances.  The word 'sexuality' in the wide sense of the word was, however, a stumbling-block and he was of the opinion that Freud put a sex meaning to everything.</p>
<p>In the students' 'Short Handbook on the Treatment of Psychological Disturbances' Serbsky allots a few pages to psycho-analysis according to Freud.  The following passage is taken from the book:  'Freud, in his later works, has considerably widened the conception of the psychical trauma, but has retained the sexual character inasmuch as sexuality (libido) is given the widest meaning, to include even the sucking of the infant at the breast and the excretory functions, etc.  The source of neurosis, according to Freud, is always to be found in infantile sexual experiences in the widest sense of the word; these experiences are repressed as they come into conflict with the moral demands of the growing ego and the outer world.  This exclusively sexual character at the bottom of every trauma arouses the opposition of other authorities to Freud's theory.  And it is essential that other moments should be taken into account in cases of traumatic hysteria or of shock-manifestations that may result from, say, a fire or the bite of a dog, etc.  Such traumatic moments are not less important than the</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0519" prefixused="">518</n></pb>
<p2>sexual trauma in their determination.  The Freudian school answers that this hypothesis does not alter the case, for the later aetiological moments are but the means taken to present the latent dispositions in the manifest form, and these latent dispositions are rooted in infantile sexuality.  The Freudian theory deserves the greatest attention, for upon it is founded a therapeutic treatment which has already shown many important and remarkable results.'</p2><p>Divergence of opinion on the sexual theory made no difference in the friendly relations between the director and the clinical practitioners.  Professor Serbsky continued to give his whole-hearted interest to the out-patients' department with Drs. Assatini, Dowbrija and Ossipow in daily attendance, each being responsible for two days' service weekly.  Unfortunately events connected with the University in 1911 moved against the continuance of Professor Serbsky as director.  He resigned his post and out of personal respect practically all the physicians went out with him, irrespective of their divergent political opinions.  The out-patients' department, and what was even more of a deprivation, the clinical library were now closed to them, but it was not long before a new and independent society devoted to psychiatry was founded by these late university professors and sympathisers.  It was known as the 'Lesser Friday Society'.  Here Dr. O. Felzmann distinguished himself by his energy and interest in psycho-analysis.  He had already in the university days given proof of his ability in his excellent reports.  In 1912, this 'Lesser Friday Society' became independent of 'The Friday Society' but continued its friendly relations with this latter.  In both societies Professor Serbsky acted as chairman at meetings, but the 'Lesser Friday Society' differed from other medical societies in opening its membership not only to doctors but to specialists of kindred subjects, such as criminology, pedagogy, psychology, etc.  The meetings of the 'Lesser Friday' were popular and well attended.  Here Freudian theories were well to the fore, and in 1914 a programme was arranged for the special study of the Freudian conceptions.  At the outbreak of war, many of the members were swept into the service of their country and the society was closed down.</p>
<p>The latest scientific intelligence reports a considerable interest in Moscow for psycho-analysis.  At the beginning of March 1921 a society was formed for the study of the principles of creative art.  It</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0520" prefixused="">519</n></pb>
<p2>began with a membership of eight; three of these are doctors whose names as contributors to the <i>Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse</i> are not unknown to psycho-analysts:  Professor Ermakow, the chairman of the Society, also Dr. Bernstein and Dr. Wulff.  Professor Syderow and Gabritschewski, the former holding a chair in aesthetics, and the latter one in philosophy, are also members.</p2><p>Appended is a list of papers read and of subjects discussed at the meetings.</p>

<p>In July Dr. Ermakow founded an institute for children up to three years of age, in which all those persons who look after the children will be analysed, in order to nullify the injurious effects of their own complexes on the work.  Dr. Ermakow is the director of the institute and Dr. Wulff his assistant.</p>
