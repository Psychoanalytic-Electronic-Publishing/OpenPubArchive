        <p>AS USED HERE, the term schizophrenia does not refer to a disease within a person, or to
            an entity somehow apart from the involvement of man with his surroundings. For the
            purposes of this presentation the word indicates a process of behavioral patterns,
            reflecting to an as yet imprecisely determined extent previous, present, and anticipated
            interpersonal, social, and cultural experience. "Schizophrenia" gains meaning as we
            consider the uniqueness of the patient (whose behavior is schizophrenic), his associates
            (those with whom he is more or less schizophrenic), the people of his past (with whom he
            learned how to live and began to manifest schizophrenic behavior), his expectations of
            the future (which may seem to require the perpetuation of psychosis), and situations in
            which variations of the disorder appear. In brief, the term may be used to describe a
            complex of operations in a social field.</p>
