<p lgrid="SEA33a3">How little the so-called clinical education acquired in our hospitals suffices for the needs of practical physicians is most strikingly shown, perhaps, from the example of ‘neurasthenia’. That pathological condition of the nervous system may comfortably be described as the commonest of all the diseases in our society: it complicates and aggravates most other clinical pictures in patients of the better classes and it is either still quite unknown to the many scientifically educated physicians or is regarded by them as no more than a modern name with an arbitrarily compounded content. Neurasthenia is not a clinical picture in the sense of textbooks based too exclusively on pathological anatomy: it should rather be described as a mode of reaction of the nervous system. It would deserve the most general attention on the part of physicians who are working scientifically-no less attention than it has already found among physicians who are working as therapists, among directors of sanatoria, etc. A recommendation to wider circles is therefore the due of the present short work, with its felicitous, though intentionally high-pitched, descriptions and its proposals and observations touching on social conditions. These, as its author suspects, will not always meet with his colleagues' agreement, though it will everywhere arouse their interest. His remark on compulsory military service as a cure for the evils of civilized life and his proposal that periodic recuperation should be made possible for the working middle-class in times of good health by <i>State</i> assistance-these are open to manifold objections. It must be admitted, however, that the booklet treats of important questions of medical care in an imaginative manner.</p>

<p lgrid="SEA33a5">[During the period after Freud's return to Vienna from Paris he did a certain amount of reviewing for medical periodicals. The <i>two</i> reviews which are translated here are, however, the only ones that have been found which deal with psychopathology; the remainder are of a neurological character. They seem never to have been reprinted in German, and the two present translations (by James Strachey) are probably the first into English.]</p></ftn><ftn type="PG" id="F002" label="2">

<p lgrid="SEA33a8"><sm>The</sm> therapeutic procedure proposed by Weir Mitchell, the highly original nerve specialist in Philadelphia, was first recommended in Germany by Burkart and has been given full recognition during the last year in a lecture by Leyden. This procedure, by a combination of rest in bed, isolation, feeding-up, massage and electricity in a strictly regulated manner, overcomes severe and long-established states of nervous exhaustion. It is Leyden, too, who was responsible for arranging the translation of the present short volume. It contains the most valuable advice for the selection of cases suitable for the treatment in question and some interesting remarks on the operation of the different therapeutic forces which compose the Weir Mitchell treatment. It will no doubt bring a widening of his knowledge to every physician. The specifically English arrangement of the sentences and thoughts has perhaps been preserved too exactly in the translation. The terms ‘hysteria’ and ‘hysterical’ are employed for the most part in the vulgar and not in the scientific sense of that much-abused word.</p>
