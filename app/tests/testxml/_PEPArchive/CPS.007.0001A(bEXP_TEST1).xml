        <p>THIS IS THE SECOND in a series of papers reporting my current concepts about autism,
            symbiosis, and individuation. I am concerned, here, not only with patients suffering
            from schizophrenia of whatever degree of severity, but with, for example, the
            subtly-present autism that emerges in the course of the neurotic patient's analysis.</p>
        <p>In the first paper, which dealt with pathologic symbiosis and autism, I mentioned
            that</p>
        <quote>
            <p>As the months and years of the analyst's work with the autistic patient wear on, the
                analyst is given to feel unneeded, incompetent, useless, callous, and, essentially,
                    <i>non-human</i> in relation to his so troubled and beseeching and reproachful,
                but so persistently autistic, patient. It is essential that the analyst be able to
                endure this long period—a period in which, despite perhaps abundant data from the
                patient, transference-interpretations are rarely feasible—in order that the
                patient's transference-regression can reach the early level of ego-development at
                which, in the patient's infancy or very early childhood, his potentialities for a
                healthy mother-infant symbiosis became distorted into a defensively autistic mode of
                ego functioning. At that level of ego-development the infant or young child had not
                yet come to achieve a perceptual and experiential differentiation between himself
                and his mother, <i>nor between his mother and the surrounding non-human world</i>.
                When in the evolution of the transference that early level of ego-functioning
                becomes accessible, then it is possible for therapeutically symbiotic processes to
                occur between patient and analyst, and be interpretable as such. … patient and
                analyst … experience one another and themselves in a manner analogous to that in
                which a healthy mother and a healthy infant are immersed, as being far more than
                merely human in the adult sense, but as forming confluently a whole growth-world."
