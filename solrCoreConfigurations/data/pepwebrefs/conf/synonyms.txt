# There are two ways to specify synonym mappings as listed below. We will discuss both the options with example.
#    - Two comma-separated lists of words with the symbol “=>” between them. If the token matches any word on
#        the left, then the list on the right is substituted. The original token will not be included
#        unless it is also in the list on the right.
#    - A comma-separated list of words. If the token matches any of the words, then all the words in the list are
#         substituted, which will include the original token.
