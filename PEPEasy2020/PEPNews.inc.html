Since we cannot test the other institutional logins other than OpenAthens, please let us know if you have difficulty with them by using the report a problem option on the Menu.</li>

     <p class="date">January 17, 2017</p>
     <p class="description" style="display: block;">We are very pleased to announce the release of the 2017 version of the PEP-Web Archive. &nbsp;The annual release means that another year of the current publications move out of the publisher’s embargo period: subscribers now have access to the 2013 issues of current journals with three year embargoes, and 2011 issues of journals with… <a href="#" onclick="jQuery(this).parent().toggle().next().toggle(); return false;">[ + ]</a></p>
     <div class="content" style="display: none;">
       <p>We are very pleased to announce the release of the <em>2017 version of the <strong>PEP-Web Archive</strong></em>. &nbsp;The annual release means that another year of the current publications move out of the publisher's <a href="http://support.pep-web.org/embargoed-content/">embargo period</a>: subscribers now have access to the <em><strong>2013</strong></em> issues of current journals with three year embargoes, and <em><strong>2011</strong></em> issues of journals with  five year embargoes. In addition, we've added over 43&nbsp;thousand pages of new material! &nbsp;Available immediately on PEP-Web, we have:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.psicoterapiaescienzeumane.it/">Psicoterapia e Scienze Umane</a>&nbsp;(Italian) 1967-present</li>
       <li><a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/10810">Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies</a>&nbsp;1999-2003</li>
       </ul>
       <p>and coming soon…</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Chinese Annual of The International Journal of Psychoanalysis&nbsp;(2017-)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>and of course we’ve been adding many new videos to PEP-Web throughout the year–with a lot more to come.</p>
       <p>We also want to call your attention to a new journal entry: <a href="http://www.pep-web.org/toc.php?journal=ijpsppsc"><em><strong>Psychoanalysis, Self and Context</strong></em></a>. &nbsp;This is a new name for the <em>International Journal of Applied Psychoanalysis</em>, beginning in 2017. &nbsp;Because of the new name and banner, we’ve given it its own listing and it’s own <em>Table of Volumes</em> to preserve the history&nbsp;of the older issues. &nbsp;The first issue is now part of PEP Current (with full-text search but you may only view abstracts during the standard 3 year embargo of new material). &nbsp;Complete text of new material is available via the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/hpsp20">publisher&nbsp;site</a>.</p>
       <h3><em>PEP-Web A Library of Premier Journals, Classic Books, and Videos</em></h3>
       <p>This new 2017 release of PEP-Web contains the complete text and illustrations of <strong>72</strong><b>&nbsp;premier journals</b> in psychoanalysis, <b>100 classic psychoanalytic books</b>, and the full text and Editorial notes of the <b>24 volumes</b> of the Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud as well as the <strong>19 volume</strong> German Freud Standard Edition Gesammelte Werke. It spans over <b>146 publication years</b> and contains the full text of articles whose source ranges from <strong>1871</strong> through <b>2017</b>. There are <b>109,500&nbsp;articles</b> and over <b>15,400 figures</b> and illustrations that originally resided on <strong>2214&nbsp;volumes</strong> with over <b>993,600&nbsp;printed pages</b>. In hard copy, the PEP Archive represents a stack of paper more than <b>325 feet high</b>&nbsp;— <strong>taller than <em>Big Ben</em></strong> — and <b>weighing over 4 tons!</b></p>
       <p>PEP-Web 2017 includes new videos–we add videos throughout the year. &nbsp; &nbsp;We now have <strong>75 videos </strong>on PEP-Web&nbsp;and we have many new videos planned for 2017. &nbsp;All videos are professionally transcribed and full-text indexed. &nbsp;So when you search the article database, you can also search all the videos!</p>
       <p>PEP-Web 2017 also includes continuing weekly additions to IJP-Open, where&nbsp;you can view papers submitted to the International Journal of Psychoanalysis before peer review and before the process of development and selection, and participate in the discussion.</p>
